Dwight Yoakam  -  Readin', Rightin', Rt.23

They learned [D] readin', rightin', Route 23,
To the [G] jobs that laid waiting in those cities' factor[D]ies.
They didn't [A] know that that old highway
Could [G]lead them to a world of miser[D]y.  (FILL*1)

Have you [D] ever been down Kentucky way,
Say south of Prestonsburg?
Have you ever been up in a holler,
Or have you ever heard
A [G] mountain man cough his life away,
From diggin' that black coal in those dark [D] mines, those dark mines.
If you [C] had you might just understand
The [G] reason that they left it all be [D] hind.  (FILL*2)

'Cause they learned [D] readin', rightin', Route 23,  (with FILL*3)
To the [G]jobs that laid waiting in those cities' factor[D]ies.
They learned readin', rightin', roads to the north,  (with FILL*3)
To the [G] luxury and comfort a coal miner can't af[D]ford.

They thought readin', rightin', Route 23,  (with FILL*3)
Would [G] take them to the good life that they had never [D] seen.  (FILL*1)
They didn't [A] know that that old highway
Could [G] lead them to a world of miser[D]y.

Have you [D] ever seen 'em put the kids in the car after work on Friday night?
Pull up in a holler about 2 a.m. and see a light still burnin' bright.
Those [G] mountain folks sat up that late,
To hold those little grandkids in their [D] arms, in their arms.
And I'm [C] proud to say that I've been blessed,
And [G] touched by their sweet hillbilly [D] charm.  (FILL*4)

But they learned [D] readin', rightin', Route 23,  (with FILL*3)
To the [G] jobs that laid waiting in those cities' factor[D]ies.
They learned readin', rightin', roads to the north,  (with FILL*3)
To the [G] luxury and comfort a coal miner can't af[D]ford.

They thought readin', rightin', Route 23,  (with FILL*3)
Would [G] take them to the good life that they had never [D] seen.  (FILL*1)
They didn't [A] know that that old highway
Could [G] lead them to a world of miser[D]y.  (FILL*5)
Yeah, it turns [A] out that that old highway
Could [G] lead you to a world of miser[D]y.  (FILL*6)
