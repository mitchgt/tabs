Are you having a [D2] long [D] day
Every [D2] one you [D4] meet [D] rubs [D2] you [D] the [G] wrong way
Dirty city streets smell like an [D2] ash [D] tray
Morning [D2] bells are [D4] ring- [D] ing [D2] in your [G] ear

Is your brother on a [D2] church [D] kick
Seems like [D2] just a [D4] diff- [D] rent [D2] kind [D] of [G] dope sick
Better off to teach a dog a [D2] card [D] trick
Than try to [D2] have a [D4] point and [D2] make it [G] clear [A]

[Bm] You should [A] know, compared to [G] people on a [F#m] global scale
Our [Em] kind has had it [F#m] relatively [G] easy [A]
[Bm] And here with [A] you there's always [G] something to look [F#m] forward to
My [Em] angry heart beats [F#m] relatively [G] easy

D2 D  D D D2 D2 D4 D D2 G

I lost a good friend
At Christmas time when folks go off the deep end
His woman took the kids and he took Klonopin
Enough to kill a man of twice his size

Not for me to understand
Remember him when he was still a proud man
A vandal's smile, a baseball in his right hand
Nothing but the blue sky in his eyes

Still, compared to those a stones-throw away from you,
Our lives have both been relatively easy
Take a year and make a break there ain't that much at stake
The answers could be relatively easy

[Em] Watch that [F#m] lucky [G] man walk to work again
He [d] may not have a friend left in the [A] world
[Em] See him walking [F#m] home [G] again to sleep alone
I [D] step into a shop to buy a [A] postcard for a girl

I broke the law boys,
shooting out the windows of my loft, boys
When they picked me up, I made a big noise
Everything to blame except my mind


I should say, I keep your picture with me every day
The evenings now are relatively easy
And here with you there's always something to look forward to
My lonely heart beats relatively easy
My lonely heart beats relatively easy
