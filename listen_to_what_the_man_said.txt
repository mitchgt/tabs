[Bm7] Leaves behind a tragic world [E]
But [Am] he don't mind
[Bm] He's in love and he says love [C] is fine

Oh [C] oh yes indeed we know
People find a way to go
No [G] matter what the [G/C] man [G/B] said [G/A]

Love [C] is fine for all we know
For all we know our love will grow
No [G] matter what the [G/C] man [G/B] said [G/A]

For all we know our love will grow
[G] That's what the [G/C] man [G/B] said [G/A]
Won't you [G] listen to what the [G/C] man [G/B] said [G/A]
