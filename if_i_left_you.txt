Pretty much just C F G for verses 

If I left you
I wouldn't stay gone so long
If I left you
I'd worry how you got along

(F)But you left me(C) 
(F) Alone here in my misery (this is a walkdown from C-Am) 
(F) That's not something I would do(C) 
If I left you (G) 

If I left you
I wouldn't go out on the town
If I left you
I'd drag my heart along the ground

But you left me
Alone here in my misery
It's not something I would do
If i left you

(F)You're actin' like(G) I never cross your mind (C-Am) 
(F)I'm holed up feelin'(G) like I'm losing mine (Am G) 

Woah, but if I left you
I'd call you every single day
If I left you
I'd wonder why I went away

But you left me
Alone here in my misery
It's not something I would do
If I left you
