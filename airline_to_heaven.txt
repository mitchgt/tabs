E                        A
There's an airline plane
E          A                  E
Flies to Heaven every day
A                        E
Past them pearly gates
         A                      E
If you want to ride this train
                A                 E
Have your ticket in your hand
A                    E
Before it is too late

If the world looks wrong
And your money's spent and gone
And your friend has turned away
You can get away to Heaven
On this aeroplane
Just bow your head and pray.
E               A                  B
Them's got ears let them hear
E               A                  B
Them's got eyes let them see
E             A              E               A              E
Turn your eyes to the Lord of the skies
A                       E                          
Take that airline plane
         A                    E        
It will take you home again.
        A                    E
Yes, take you home again.
B
Yes, to your home beyond the skies.

Well, a lot of people guess
Some say no and some say yes
Will it take some and leave some behind?
But you will surely know
When to the airport go
To leave this world behind

Oh, a lot of speakers speak
And a lot of preachers preach
When you lay their salary on the line
But to bow your head and pray
Is the only earthly way
That you can fly to Heaven on time.
That you can reach Heaven on time.

Your ticket you obtain
On this heavenly airline plane
You leave your sins behind
You have got to take this flight
Might be daytime, might be night,
But you can't see your way if you're blind

The Chords are basically E A 

(E)There's an airline (A)plane (E) Flies to (A) Heaven every (E)day
(A)Past them pearly (E)Gates...

Chorus:
(E) Them's got ears let them (A)hear 
(E)Thems got eyes let them(B) see
(E) Turn your eyes to the (A)Lord of the skies
(ANd now back to verse progresion)
(E) (A)Take that airline (E)plane.  It will (A)take you home (E)again.
(A)(E)(A)  (B)Yes to your (E)home beyond the skies
