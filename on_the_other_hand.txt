[D]On one hand I count the reasons I could [G]stay with you

[D]And hold you close to me, all night [A]long.

[D]So many lover's games I could [G]play with you
      
and on that[E]hand I see no reason why it's[A] wrong


Chorus:


[n.c.]
But on the [G]other hand, There's a golden [D]band

[A]To remind of someone who would not [D]understand

[G]On one hand I could stay and be your [D]loving man

[A]But the reason I must go is on the [D]other hand


[D]In your arms I feel the passion, I [G]thought had died

[D]When I looked into your eyes   I[A] found myself

[D]When I first kissed your lips I [G]felt so alive
      
I've got[E] to hand it to you girl,  you're[A] something else

Repeat Chorus
