CAPO at First Fret 

Intro- distortion- then Em, D, C 2x 
Verses- Em, D, C
            
There's no train 
There's no boat 
There's no car to get me far enough 
There's no bus 
There's no plane 
There's no wreck to make you beg enough 
There's no drink 
There's no sleep 
There's no pill to keep you still enough 

( chorus ) 
D              C 
It's heartache weather 
       D 
Please remember 
                     C 
Things are gonna get worse 
                 Em    D    C 
Before they get better 

There's no rope 
There's no nail 
There's no psalm to make us strong enough 
There's no con 
There's no skin 
There's no beauty to help you through enough 

( Repeat Chorus ) 

There's no book 
There's no code 
There's no verse to make it hurt enough 
There's no kill 
There's no spark 
There's no script to help you live enough 
There's no cause 
There's no drum 
There's no breath that gets you near enough 

( Repeat chorus twice )
