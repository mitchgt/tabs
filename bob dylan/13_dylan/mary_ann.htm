Oh fare thee well my own true love
G                        D
Fare thee well but for a while

The ship is waitin' an' the wind blows high

<pre>
Ten thousand miles away from home
Ten thousand miles or more
The sea may freeze an' the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you, 
Mary Ann.

Oh don't you see that crow fly high
She'll surely turn to white
If ever I prove false to you
Let the day turn to night, my dear 
Mary Ann.

Oh, if I had a flask of gin an' sugar here for two
An' a great big bowl for to mix it in
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear 
Mary Ann
Yes I'd pour a drink for you, my dear 
Mary Ann.</pre>
