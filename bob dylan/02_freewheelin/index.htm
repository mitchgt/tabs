    <h3>Eyolf Østrem</h3>
    <p>Ah, but what can I say...! This is the album that is responsible for my addiction to
    Dylan (and not because I bought it when it was released). It is not the one I play most
    regularly, but whenever I pick it out, I ask myself why I don't do it more often.</p>
    <p>Several of the songs are part of the daily routine, of course. Don't Think Twice,
    Masters of War, Hard Rain, Girl of the North Country, not to mention Blowin' in the Wind -
    I do believe I hear at least one of these every day. Half an album of songs, almost 40
    years old, by a then folk singer, that still hold their ground in the repertory of a man
    who has for 35 of those years been a rock artist - that's in itself a brand of quality.
    And the rest of the songs ain't so bad either.</p>
    <p>What this album first of all shows (and which was confirmed by <em>Good As I Been To
    You</em>) is what an accomplished guitar player Dylan was - and still is, when he wants
    to. There is some really nice guitar work on some of these tracks: the finger-picking on <a href="dont_think_twice.htm">Don't Think Twice</a> and <a href="talkin_world_war_iii_blues.htm">Talkin' WW3 Blues</a>, the free-rhythmical blues a
    la Big Joe Williams of <a href="down_the_highway.htm">Down the Highway</a>, the lyricism
    of <a href="corrina_corrina.htm">Corrina Corrina</a>, and the persistent, rhythmical
    hammering-on of <a href="masters_of_war.htm">Masters of War</a>. None of it is really
    (really) difficult - he gets as much effect as possible from techniques that are actually
    quite simple (once you master them). This is not to say that he's a cheater (those who
    have access&nbsp; to &quot;<a href="../00_misc/hero_blues.htm">Hero Blues</a>&quot;, an
    outtake from the <em>Freewheelin'</em> sessions, can hear for themselves that Dylan anno
    1963 had a quite good control of his instrument).</p>
    <p>A contributing element is the use of <a href="../roadmaps.htm">altered or open tunings.</a>
    Four of the songs on <em>Freewheelin' </em>are in open D (<a href="down_the_highway.htm">Down
    the Highway</a>, <a href="i_shall_be_free.htm">I shall be Free</a>, <a href="corrina_corrina.htm">Corrina Corrina</a> and <a href="oxford_town.htm">Oxford Town</a>)
    and two in Dropped D tuning (<a href="masters_of_war.htm">Masters of War</a> and <a href="hard_rain.htm">Hard Rain</a>). Several of the outtakes also use such tunings. It is
    noteworthy that the playing style in these songs differs considerably from the style of
    the <a href="../16_bott/index.htm"><em>Blood on the Tracks</em></a> songs, which were also
    originally played in open D tuning. It is said that it was Joni Mitchell who inspired
    and/or taught him to use open D tuning, and although he apparently knew it even ten years
    earlier, he didn't use the same style and technique then.</p>
    <p>A striking unifying feature of the playing style of <em>Freewheelin'</em> is the many
    second-inversion chords, <em>i.e.</em> chords with the fifth in the bass, such as D/a (x<strong>0</strong>0232),
    which is so prominent in <a href="blowin_in_the_wind.htm">Blowin' In The Wind</a>. Another
    (I think related) feature is the many ways he uses to avoid the dominant, such as the turn
    C - Gadd4/b - G in <a href="blowin_in_the_wind.htm">Blowin' in the Wind</a> and <a href="bob_dylans_dream.htm">Bob dylan's Dream</a>, about which I intend to write a little
    piece some day.</td>
