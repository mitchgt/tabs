<p>The challenge with this song is not the chords, which are quite simple, actually, but
the lyrics, which change quite a lot, almost from show to show, with improvised new lines
about what brings him to the door, knockin'.</p>

<p>The Am7 is played as a simple Am in most versions.</p>

<p>Unplugged version same as below, but with a capo on the 2nd fret (on Jackson's guitar;
Dylan fumbles around with an occasional lick on an uncapoed guitar).</p>

<pre>|:G . D . Am7 . . . |G . D . C . . . :|</pre>

<pre>&nbsp;
G               D            Am7
Mama, take this badge off of me
G        D         C
 I can't use it anymore.
G             D                 Am7
 It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
G                D                    C
 I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
 
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door</pre>

<h3>Live 1975 version</h3>

<p>The chords are the same as above.</p>

<p>Mama wipe the blood off of my face<br>
I can't see through it anymore<br>
I need someone to talk to, and a new hiding place<br>
I feel like I'm looking at heaven's door</p>

<p>[Roger McGuinn:]<br>
Mama I can hear that thunder roar<br>
Echoin' down from God's distant shore<br>
I can hear 'em callin' for my soul<br>
Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door</p>

Two riders are coming down<br>
Bury my heart in this ground<br>
