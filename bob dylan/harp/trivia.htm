This might very well be true, but I found out recently that the only difference
between MB and a &quot;Blues&quot; harp is that the blues harp is slightly
easier to &quot;bend&quot; on, to overblow the reads to alter the pitch.
On the other hand MBs are slightly more powerful in tone quality. SO if
you aren't sure about it, it could be that he is playing Blues harps. </i></tt></p>

<p><tt>I'm sure.</tt></p>

<p><tt><i>But I have no real info regarding Bob, I just always thought
that blues harps were tuned to a different scale.</i> </tt></p>

<p><tt>No. Scale is the same. Only the name makes beginners think the Blues
harp is *The* Blues Harp, (which doesn't necessarily make it a &quot;beginners
instrument&quot; in any derogatory sense), which is really the Marine Band.&quot;</tt></p>

<p>To clarify (i hope): the Hohner Marine Band harmonica is the standard
harmonica played by folk, country, and blues musicians from the time of
its invention to the present day. A couple of decades ago, when a lot of
newbies wanted to earn to play harmonica in the blues style (crossing keys
and bending notes) they found that this was a difficult task and took lots
of breath control. So Hohner made a version of the Marine Band with, i
believe, slightly thinner metal on the reeds, thus requiring less air to
bend the notes (overblow the reeds). They called this new brand the &quot;Blues
Harp.&quot; As noted above, the Blues Harp does not have the powerful,
clear sound of the Marine Band, so it has never been as popular with professional
musicians. Bob Dylan, as far as i know, started out with the Marine Band
and always has used that brand. </p>

too...)</p>

<p>Just in case you didn't know what to do with your paycheck this week,
I found this in the Antiques and Arts Weekly:</p>

<p>(Auction at Christie's East New York Nov. 29 will feature a '49 Martin
guitar once owned by Bob Dylan, est. $80/100,000. This is the guitar he
played in the coffee houses from Minnesota to New York City, from1959 to
1961, and at his first public appearance at Gerde's Folk City in Greenwich
Village.)</p>

<p>&quot;Other Dylan rarities include the harmonica holder he used at his
performances at Gerde's together with a Hohner Marine Band harmonica in
the key of G ($7/10,000).&quot;</p>

<p>I found this posted by Patricia Jungwirth on rec.music.dylan. She gave
me permission to cross post.</p>

<p>&gt;Could Patricia perhaps tell us what that book she mentioned, &quot;The
Harp Styles &gt;of Bob Dylan&quot;, by Amy Appleby, has to say about this?</p>

<p>To answer Rick's request, the following information has been gleaned
from Amy Appleby's book :</p>

<p>[A more complete list can be found <a HREF="harpkeys.htm">here</a>]</p>

<p>&quot;Each song is notated in the original key and position used by
Dylan on the original album release. To play these songs, he uses a total
of six harps: A, Bb, D, E, F and G. However since the arrangement of notes
is the same for all ten-hole diatonic harmonicas, you may use a harmonica
in a key other than that indicated in the legend of a specific song. Just
be aware that you will have to figure out what key you are playing in and
transpose the melody line and chords if you want to accompany yourself
or play with other musicians.&quot;</p>

<p>Each song is accompanied by a quote from Dylan, notes on guitar tunings
and illuminating comments on harmonica parts, guitar and vocal oddities
- very interesting. Here's the accompanying quote and notes to 'Baby I'm
In The Mood For You'.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;Most of the time I would blow out of the harmonica because
everybody sucks in. The proper way to play is like Little Walter or Sonny
Boy Williamson would play - which would be to cross it - and I found myself
blowing out more because nobody was doing that in that area. And that's
what defined that harmonica and guitar sound which I hadn't heard until
that point. I just stumbled on it one day.&quot;</p>

<p>Recorded in Mid-1962 at the Freewheelin' Bob Dylan sessions, this song
was officially released in 1985 on the Biograph album. This song provides
an extended showcase for Dylan's considerable harp talent. There's an exciting
high-energy solo after each of the four verses - and a short ending solo
to cap it off. (Note that the solo after the third verse is four bars shorter
than the others).</p>

<p>Dylan plays Baby I'm In The Mood For You in the key of G Major using
a G harmonica (first position). These solos are built around blow notes
- and display Dylan's virtuosic straight-harp style. In the last four bars
of the first harp solo, Dylan introduces a chugging rhythm - a technique
commonly used by old-time blues players to imitate the sound of a train.
Follow the markings that indicate syncopated slurred tonguing and throat
popping to get a feel for this chugging technique, which is used extensively
in the three solos that follow. You may want to practice these rhythms
slowly at first, but keep in mind that the train rhythms won't sound quite
right until you bring them up to speed. In a couple of spots, Dylan punctuates
his solos with a vocalized whoop - a device reminiscent of the great blues
harp player Sonny Terry. &gt;&gt;</p>

<p>More of Dylan's comments on harps, braces and styles can be heard on
the 'Folksinger's Choice' interview from 1962, where Dylan says he used
to play the little Hohner harps which you hold inside your mouth - but
he had to give them up because he had 'bad teeth' and they magnetized the
fillings!</p>

<p>I have a theory:</p>

<p>Just before he quit play the harp on a regular basis, reports of a back
brace were circulating. Then he started playing the harp without even holding,
let alone playing, the guitar. Now he is back to guitar with little or
no harp.</p>

<p>Could it be that playing the guitar and harmonica is awkward and would
cause back injuries after 40 years?</p>

<p>Occupational hazard? Maybe he'll apply for workman's compensation.</p>
