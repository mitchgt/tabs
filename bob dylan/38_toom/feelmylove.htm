<h1>Make You Feel My Love</h1>

<p>Words and music by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Time Out Of Mind</a> </em>(1997)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>This is a piano tune on the record, but harmonically it is an almost exact copy of
&quot;Simple twist of fate&quot;, and can preferably be played on guitar in open tuning (E
or D), with the chords 054000, 044000, 034000, 020120, xx5450, 000000, 222222 (or even
better 020220), x02100, 000000 for the verse and 021020, 000000, 010010, 021020, 000000,
021020, 000000, 222120, x02102 (or -00 or -20), 000000 for the bridge. Got that...?</p>

<p>In standard tuning it is most easily played using G as tonic, but I give it here in C,
as that is closest to the key of the recording. Capo 1st fret (Original key Db major). </p>

<pre>C                        C/B
When the rain is blowing in your face
C7/Bb                  F/A
and the whole world is on your case
Fm/Ab           C/G 
I could offer a warm embrace
D9/F#       G/F     C
to make you feel my love</pre>

<pre>When evening shatters and the stars appear
and there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
to make you feel my love</pre>

<pre>F                            C
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
C+          F            C
but I would never do you wrong
F                             C
I've known it from the moment that we met
Dm                            G
no doubt in my mind where you belong</pre>

<pre>I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
to make you feel my love</pre>

<pre>The storms are raging on the rolling sea
and on the highway of regret
the winds of change are blowing wild and free
you ain't seen nothing like me yet</pre>

<pre>I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
nothing that I wouldn't do
go to the ends of the earth for you
to make you feel my love</pre>
