<pre>    Em
<tt>I'm walking, 
         D               Em
through streets that are dead 
                 
Walking, 
D                      Em
walking with you in my head
               D
My feet are so tired 
   B           Am     Am7
My brain is so wired 
                   Em
And the clouds are weeping</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>Did I, 
hear someone tell a lie 
Did I, 
hear someone's distant cry
I spoke like a child 
You destroyed me with a smile 
while i was sleeping</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>G A                   G A
    I'm sick of love<a HREF="lovesick.htm#*)">*)
</a>                Em
That I'm in the thick of it 
G A                   G A
    This kind of love 
       Em 
I'm so sick of it</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>I see, 
I see lovers in the meadow 
I see, 
I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them 'til they're gone 
and they leave me hangin' on 
to a shadow</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>I'm sick of love 
I hear the clock tick 
this kind of love 
I'm lovesick</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>Sometimes 
the silence can be like thunder 
Sometimes 
I wanna take to the road of plunder
Could you ever be true? 
I think of you and I wonder</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>I'm sick of love 
I wish I'd never met you 
I'm sick of love 
I'm tryin' to forget you</tt></pre>

<pre>Em                      D
<tt>Just don't know what to do
C                 B          Em 
I'd give anything to be with you</tt></pre>

<br>
&quot;stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love&quot;

<ul>
  <p>The Song of Solomon, 2:8</p>
</ul>

<p>(in the absence of jh, I feel it's my duty to point out that the phrase<br>
&quot;sick of love&quot; here means &quot;sick with love&quot;. Of course, we all know
that<br>
&quot;stay&quot; means strengthen, &quot;flagons&quot; were cakes (not wine bottles - they<br>
didn't have them!) and &quot;apples&quot; were probably oranges)<br>
