<h2>Million Miles</h2>

<p>Words and music by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Time Out Of Mind</a> </em>(1997)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 4th fret (Original key Abm). The sevenths are generally &quot;instable&quot;. Any
bluesy addition to the basic chord goes (and probably is somewhere in the soundscape of
the recording...).</p>

<pre>Em
You took a part of me that I really miss

I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
    A7
You told yourself a lie
                                     Em
Thats alright mama I told myself one too
  B7                        A7                         Em
I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

<pre>You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People asked about you, I didn't tell them everything I knew
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

<pre>I'm driftin in and out of dreamless sleep
Somehow my memory's in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
And I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

<pre>I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low <a HREF="million_miles.htm#*)">*)
</a>I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder, tell us just what its all coming to
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

<pre> ...</pre>

<pre>Well I don't dare close my eyes and I don't dare wink
Maybe in the next life I'll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don't know who
Well I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

<pre>Yes the last thing you said before you hit the street
Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet
I said thats alright mamma you, you do what you gotta do
Well I try to get closer I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

<pre>Rock me pretty baby rock me all at once, 
Rock me for a little while 
Rock me for a couple of months And I'll rock you too
I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

<pre>Well there's voices in the night trying to be heard
I'm sitting here listening to every mind-pollutin' word
I know plenty of people put me up for a day or two
Yes I try to get closer but I'm still a million miles from you</pre>

'Turn your lamp down low' is from Blind Willie Mctell's great Statesboro Blues. <br>
