<h1>Can't Wait</h1>

<p>Words and music by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Time Out Of Mind</a> </em>(1997)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 4th fret (Original key Ab blues)<br>
The recurrent chord is a shimmering Esus4 which is never really resolved - or, for the
sake of convenience, Em.</p>

<pre>Em
I can't wait
A                         Em
Wait for you to change my mind

It's late
A                     Em
I'm tryin to walk the line

Well it's way past midnight

And there's some people all around
A
Some on their way up

Some on their way down
Em                               A
The air burns and I'm tryin to think straight
C                B7                    Em
And I don't know how much longer I can wait</pre>

<pre>
I'm your man
I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand
That my heart can't go on beating without you
Well your loveliness has wounded me
I'm reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so
I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait</pre>

<pre>Skies are gray
I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day
It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go <a HREF="cantwait.htm#1)">1)
</a>If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do
I'd like to think I could control myself
But it isn't true
That's how it is
When things disintegrate
And I don't know how much longer I can wait</pre>

  <pre>              A
I'm doomed to love you
                              Em
I been rollin' through stormy weather
             A
I'm thinkin' of you
                                 Bsus4
And all the places we could roam together</pre>

<pre>            Em
It's mighty funny
The end of time has just begun
Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one
Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you
Somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this day
I don't know how much longer I can wait</pre>

<p>The lyric 

<ul>
  <p>&quot;<i>night or day, it doesn't matter anymore where I go, I just go</i>&quot; </p>
</ul>

<p>is conspicuously similar to a lyric in the Grateful Dead tune 'Crazy Fingers' which
goes 

<ul>
  <p>&quot;<i>gone are the days we stopped to decide where we should go, we just ride</i>&quot;,
  </p>
</ul>

<p>by robert hunter. somewhat similar in construction and definitely in content.</p>

<h3>2000 version</h3>

<p>The main changes are in the pace and the mood of the playing, not really much in the
arrangement. <br>
B7add11=x21200. Or play B7-10 (x21230)</p>
