<h1>Not Dark Yet</h1>

<p>Words and music by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Time Out Of Mind</a> </em>(1997)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Sounds very C major-ish in the chords, but can of course be played in E directly. The
C/G chords of the second part of the verse contain a D on some occasions. <br>
Once again:&nbsp;Capo 4th fret (original key E major)</p>

<pre>C                  F/C                  C   
Shadows are falling and I been here all day
                    F/C                    C
It's too hot to sleep and time is running away
G            G/F      C/E         C 
Feel like my soul has turned into steel
Am                 C/G            F          C
I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal
G                G/F            C/E     C
There's not even room enough to be anywhere
Am       C/G      F                     C
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there</pre>

<pre>Well my sense of humanity is going down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writin' what was in her mind
I just don't see why I should even care
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there</pre>

<pre>Well I been to London and I been to gay Paris
I followed the river and I got to the sea
I've been down to the bottom of a world full of lies
I ain't lookin for nothin' in anyone's eyes
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there</pre>

<pre>I was born here and I'll die here, against my will<a href="notdarkyet.htm#*)">*)
</a>I know it looks like I'm movin' but I'm standin' still
Every nerve in my body is so vacant and numb
I can't even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don't even hear the murmur of a prayer
It's not dark yet, but it's getting there</pre>

<p><a name="*)"></a><b>*) </b><i>From a recension by Martin Grossman</i></p>

<p><b>Dylan the Talmudist </b></p>

<p>In the last verse of &quot;Not Dark Yet,&quot; Dylan paraphrases lines from the Pirke
Avot, which lends credence to the rumors that he has been studying Talmud in recent years.
He sings,

<ul>
  <li><i>I was born here and I'll die here against my will </i></li>
</ul>

<p>In the Pirke Avot (Ethics of the Fathers), 4:29, the language is strikingly similar: 

<ul>
  <li><i>&quot;And not let your evil inclination assure you that the grave will be a <br>
    place of refuge for you -- for against your will you were created, <br>
    against your will you were born, against your will you live, against <br>
    your will you die, and against your will you are destined to give an <br>
    account before the Supreme King of Kings, the Holy One Blessed be He.&quot; </i></li>
</ul>
