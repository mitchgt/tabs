<pre>     Am
Your breath is sweet
                       G
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky.
     F      
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
       E
On the pillow where you lie.
    Am
But I don't sense affection
   G
No gratitude or love
     F
Your loyalty is not to me
    E
But to the stars above.

F                              E
One more cup of coffee for the road,
F                              E
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
              Am
To the valley below.

Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade.
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food.

One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below.

Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself.
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf.
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark.

One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below.</pre>
