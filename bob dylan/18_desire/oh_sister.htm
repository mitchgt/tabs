<pre>G           Bm             C  (/b Am) G
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
G              Em              C    G
You should not treat me like a stranger.
G          Bm                 C  (/b   Am) G
Our Father would not like the way that you act
G            Em          C  G
And you must realize the danger.

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth,
To love and follow His direction?</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>F            C
We grew up together
         G
From the cradle to the grave
   F               C
We died and were reborn
            G         D      (/c-b-a)
And then mysteriously saved.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door,
Don't turn away, you'll create sorrow.
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow.</pre>

<pre>C            Em             F           C
 Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
G              Am              F    C
You should not treat me like a stranger.
C          Em                 F            C
Our Father would not like the way that you act
C            Am          F  C
And you must realize the danger.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Bb           F
We grew up together
         C
From the cradle to the grave
Bb                 F

<h3>Budokan version</h3>

<p>The verses are sung over a sustained G minor chord. The only difference is the bridge,
which is played:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Bb           C
We grew up together
         Gm
From the cradle to the grave
   Bb              C
We died and were reborn
            Gm
And then mysteriously saved.</pre>
