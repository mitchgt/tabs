Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Desire</em></a> (1976)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Note that the descending riff that goes through the song closely resembles the
characteristic passage in <a href="../28_biograph/abandoned_love.htm">Abandoned Love</a>,
written at about the same time.</p>

<pre>G/d        D'         G    D
 I like to spend some time in Mozambique
G/d        D'     G  D
 The sunny sky is aqua blue
G/d          D'      G  D
 And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek.
C          G       D
 It's very nice to stay a week or two,
C          G       D
 And maybe fall in love just me and you.</pre>

<pre>
There's lots of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Bm                       F#m
Lying next to her by the ocean
Em                            D
Reaching out and touching her hand,
Bm                      F#m
Whispering your secret emotion
G                  A
Magic in a magical land.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>
And when it's time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea,
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it's so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique.</pre>
