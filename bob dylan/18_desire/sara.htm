<h1>Sara</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Desire</em></a> (1976), and in a live version on <em><a
href="../42_bs5/index.htm">Live 1975</a> </em>(2002)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The Am in the chorus (second &quot;Sara&quot;) sounds like a C on the album because of
the bass, but Am is definitely what he used to play in concert, and it sounds better too.</p>

<p>The <em>Live 1975 </em>version is virtually identical to the album version, except for
some lyric changes (see below).</p>

<hr>

<pre>  Em                Am  
I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky,
         D                        Em
When the children were babies and played on the beach.
    Em                   Am
You came up behind me, I saw you go by,
         D                   Em
You were always so close and still within reach.
G Bm  Am
Sara, Sara,
D                         C           Em
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
G Bm  Am
Sara, Sara,
D                      C       Em
So easy to look at, so hard to define.

I can still see them playin' with their pails in the sand,
They run to the water their buckets to fill.
I can still see the shells fallin' out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill.

Sara, Sara,
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life,
Sara, Sara,
Radiant jewel, mystical wife.

Sleepin' in the woods by a fire in the night,
Drinkin' white rum in a Portugal bar,
Them playin' leapfrog and hearin' about Snow White,
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar.  *)

Sara, Sara,
It's all so clear, I could never forget,
Sara, Sara,
Lovin' you is the one thing I'll never regret.

I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells,
I'd taken the cure and had just gotten through,
Stayin' up for days in the Chelsea Hotel,
Writin' &quot;Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot; for you.

Sara, Sara,
Wherever we travel we're never apart.
Sara, oh Sara,
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart.

How did I meet you? I don't know.
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm.
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm.    **)

Sara, oh Sara,
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress,
Sara, Sara,
You must forgive me my unworthiness.

Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore.
You always responded when I needed your help,
You gave me a map and a key to your door.

Sara, oh Sara,
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow,
Sara, oh Sara,
Don't ever leave me, don't ever go.</pre>

<p>Lyric changes in the <em>Live 1975 </em>version:</p>

<p>*) Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night<br>
where you fought for my soul and went up against the odds<br>
I was too young to know you were doing it right<br>
and you did it with strength that belonged to the gods.</p>

<p>The order of the two following refrains is reversed.</p>

<p>**) This verse is left out from the <em>Live 1975 </em>version</p>
