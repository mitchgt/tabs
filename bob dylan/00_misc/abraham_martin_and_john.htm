<h1>Abraham, Martin and John</h1>

<p>Written by Dick Holler<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan during the 1980 and 1981 gospel tours, in duet with Clydie King.<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Played with Bob at the piano, in C# major. I'd strongly suggest a capo on the 1st fret.</p>

 Has anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?

 Can you tell me where he's gone?

He freed a lot of people,

Now I just looked around and he's gone.

Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
