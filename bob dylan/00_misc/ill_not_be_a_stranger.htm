<pre>     C                        F
I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
      C                        G
I'm acquainted with folks over there.
            C
There'll be friends there to greet me, 
            F
There'll be loved ones to meet me
       C             G         C
At the gates of that city four square. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>            G
Through the years, through the tears, 
        C
They've gone one by one.
            G
But they'll wait at the gate
  C
Until my race is run.
     C                        F
I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city
      C             G          C
I'm acquainted with folks over there. </pre>
  <pre>c . . G . . C . . | . . .</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
I've a home on the streets paved with gold.
I'll feel right at home there 
In that beautiful somewhere
With the loved ones whose memory I hold. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Through the years, through the tears, 
They've gone one by one.
But they'll wait at the gate
Until my race is run.
I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city
I'm acquainted with folks over there. </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city;
There'll be no lonely days over there.
There'll be no stormy weather 
But a great time together
On the streets of that city four square. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Through the years, through the tears, 
They've gone one by one.
But they'll wait at the gate
Until my race is run.
I'll not be a stranger when I get to that city
I'm acquainted with folks over there.</pre>
