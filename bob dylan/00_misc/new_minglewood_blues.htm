I was born in a desert, Raised in a lion's den

And my number one occupation is stealing women from their other men </pre>

<pre>D7                   C7                         A
Busted down in Texas, busted jail, I'm gone for good
D7                   C7                            A
Busted down in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good

Well the sheriff couldn't catch me but his little girl sure wished they could

<pre>Doc says I'm crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
Doctor says I'm crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
The little girl says I'm [a sinner]**), but the preacherman calls me a saint 

[instr. verse]

Got lots of whiskey, [...] start lookin' good  *)
Got lots of whiskey, [...] start lookin' good
Couple more shots of whiskey, I'm goin' back to Minglewood</pre>

<p>*) Dylan's lyrics are inaudible (to me anyway). The Grateful Dead's version goes:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, a couple shots of whiskey, women round here start looking good<br>
Well, a couple shots of whiskey, women round here start looking good<br>
A couple more shots of whiskey, I'm going down to Minglewood&quot;</p>

<p>**) Dylan sings something else - probably intending to sing the same as in the last
verse.</p>
