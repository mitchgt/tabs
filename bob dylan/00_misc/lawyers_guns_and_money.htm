<pre>        D                  A              E . . . 
Well, I went home with the waitress
     D             A        D . A .  
Just like I always do
D                A     E . . .
How was I to know
D                          A  .  [opening riff x2]
She was with the Russians, too

I was gambling in Havana
I took a little risk
Send lawyers, guns and money
Dad, get me out of this

I'm the innocent bystander
Somehow I got stuck
Between the rock and the hard place
        [riff x2]
And I'm down on my luck

    [riff x1]
I'm down on my luck

Now I'm hiding in Honduras
I'm a desperate man
Send lawyers, guns and money
The shit has hit the fan

Send lawyers, guns and money...</pre>
