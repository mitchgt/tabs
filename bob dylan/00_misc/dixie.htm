<h1>Dixie</h1>

<p>Trad.<br>
Played by Bob Dylan and band in <i>Masked and Anonymous</i> (2003)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>Someone, probably Dylan, plays the F (or something like it) in the refrain straight through 
the following D, and embellishes the following G with a C/g-G figure. The second 
time, the F is played right through the G as well. Economy of means, I think 
it's called...<br>
The Csus4 in the last line of the refrain could just as well be played as an F 
(or for that matter, as a G - works just as well).</p>

<hr>


<pre>  C
I wish I was in the land of cotton
F
Old times there are not forgotten 
      C
Look away, look away
      G         C
Look away, Dixieland</pre>


<pre>In Dixieland where I was born,
Early on one frosty morning
Look away, Look away,
Look away, Dixieland</pre>

<blockquote>


<pre>  C             F       D     G
I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
   C              F      
In Dixieland I'll take my stand
   C               G
to live and die in Dixie,
 C     G     C        Csus4    C
Away, away, away down south in Dixie
 C     G     C        Csus4    C
Away, away, away down south in Dixie</pre>
