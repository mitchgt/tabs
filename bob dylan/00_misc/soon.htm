<pre>E              Bm                  C#7
Soon [all the] nights they will be ended,
F#m            Am              Amaj7 B
Soon, all true love will be so splen-did.
E               E7             A
 I've found the happiness I've waited for.
F#m       G#              C#m          A   B
 The only girl that I was waiting for.</pre>

<pre>    E             Bm               C#7
Oh, soon a little cabin there will find us, 
F#m          Am             Amaj7 B
Safe all our cares so far behind  us
E             E7                   A           Am7-5
 When you are mine this world will be in tune
E               B        G#m     C#7
Let's make that day come soon.
F#m             B        E
Let's make that day come soon.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>Soon the lonely nights will be ended,
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended.
I've found the happiness I've waited for.
The only girl that I was fated for.

Oh, soon a little cottage will find us
Safe with all our cares far behind us
The day your mine this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon.</pre>
