<h1>If I Don't Be There By Morning</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan for Eric Clapton<br>
Released by Eric Clapton on his album <em>Backless</em> (1978)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>To get that high ringing <em>b </em>from the piano, the song has to be played around
the 7th fret, with barre chords (or a capo). The guitar that can be heard on the tape
probably plays with a capo on the 2nd fret and the chords in the 2nd version below.<br>
Another alternative is to play with a capo on the 4th fret with the chords in the second
column below.</p>

<p>Chords:</p>

<pre>
I been runnin' 
from Memphis to LA 
Had an appointment 
set sometime for today 
And if I don't be there by morning 
She'll know that I 
must have gone the other way. </pre>

 Finding my way back to you, girl, 
           B                    E
lonely and blue, and mistreated too, 
D#m7                   G#m 
 Sometimes I think of you, girl, 
      C#m7                 F#6   F#7
is it true you think of me too? </pre>
  <pre>[instr. verse]</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>
I got a woman 
living in LA 
I got a woman 
waiting for my pay, 
And if I don't be there by morning 
Pack my clothes, 
get down on your knees and pray. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Finding my way back to you, girl, 
lonely and blue, and mistreated too, 
Sometimes I think of you, girl, 
is it true you think of me too? </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I left my woman 
with a twenty-dollar bill, 
I left her waiting, 
I hope she's waiting for me still. 
But if I don't be there by morning 
I guess that I, 
I never will. </pre>
