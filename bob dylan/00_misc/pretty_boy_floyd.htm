<pre>          G       .  .  .   .     .
If you'll gather 'round me, people,
  C            G
A story I will tell
      C          /g        D/f#
About Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
                  G
Oklahoma knew him well. </pre>

<pre>It was in the town of Shawnee,
On a Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in a wagon
And into town they rode. </pre>

<pre>There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Using vulgar words of language,
An' his wife she overheard. </pre>

<pre>Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down. </pre>

<pre>Now he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name. </pre>

<pre>He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore,
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>[Instrumental verse, replacing the verse:
But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes. ]</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill. </pre>

<pre>T'was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say: </pre>

<pre>You say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief. </pre>

<pre>Well, as through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen. </pre>

<pre>But as through this world you ramble,
As through this world you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home.</pre>

<pre>[Two instrumental verses, then:]</pre>
