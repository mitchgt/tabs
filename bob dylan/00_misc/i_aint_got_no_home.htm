<h1>I Ain't Got No Home </h1>

<p>Written by Woody Guthrie to the tune &quot;This World is not My Home&quot; (See <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/Nashville/3448/iaint.html">Manfred Helfert's site</a> for
details)<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan and The Band at the Woody Guthrie tribute concert, Carnegie Hall,
NY, Jan 20, 1968.<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The chorus is a cappella - the chords indicate which harmonies they sing.</p>

<p>The guitar part is probably played with a capo on the 5th fret (see below). </p>

<pre>c                   F                     	 C
I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round,
C                                  D               G
A hard working ramblin' man, and I go from town to town.
C                   F               
police make it hard  wherever I may go
    C                           G        C
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.</pre>

<pre>I was farmin' on the shares, always I was poor;
My crops I'd lay away into the banker's store.
My wife she took down and died upon the cabin floor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. </pre>

<pre>Well, as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
This wide open world, she's a funny old place to be;
The gamblin' man is rich, the workin' man is poor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.</pre>

<blockquote>

I ain't got no home in this world anymore. </pre>

<p>Additional verse, not sung by Dylan:</p>

<pre>My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road,
A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;
Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. </pre>
