<p>&quot;Kinda' got lost comin' up here tonight. Took a subway. Got off somewhere on 156th
Street. Started to walkin' back. I got hung up on a Cadillac store down there. So I'm not
here so on time. I was almost run over by a bus. Took another subway, down on 34th street
and I walked up here. </p>

<p>I come pretty prepared tonight, I got a list on my guitar. This is a new list, I used
to have one on my guitar about a month ago,that was no good. Figured I'd get a good list,
so I went around... I put the list on first, then I went around to other guuitar players,
and - sort of looked at their lists, and I copied down songs on mine.</p>

<p>Some of these I don't know so good.&quot;<br>

Little girl, little girl, where you been so long?
    G         D    G       D
Not even your mama knows.
       G             G                C        
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines.
      G            D            G         D
And I shivered the whole night long.


My daddy, he was a railroad man,
Till the [...] town.
His head, was found neath' the driving wheel
And his body has never been found

[...], he love you, for a thousand times
And he's taken all the love I had to give.
He's taken my house, he's taken my love.
I'll never will love as long as I live.

Little girl, little girl, where you been so long?
Not even your mama knows.
In the pines, in the pines, where the sun never shines.
And I shivered the whole night long.</pre>

The longest train I ever seen 
    A      E       A
was on the Georgia line
    A              D/a     A
The engine fast it seeks a cart, 
       A         E       A
and it came past by last night</pre>

<pre>In the pines, in the pines, 
where the sun never shines
and I shivered where the cold winds blow</pre>

<pre>Black girl, black girl,*)             *) [other times it is &quot;dark girl&quot;]
don't you lie to me 
tell me where 
did you sleep last night</pre>

<pre>In the pines, in the pines, 
where the sun never shines
I shivered where the cold winds blow.</pre>

<pre>I asked my captain for the time of day 
He got so mad he threw his watch away
The long steel rail that shone 'cross town
I'm on my way back home</pre>

<pre>In the pines, in the pines, 
where the sun never shines
And I shivered where the cold winds blow.</pre>

<pre>In the pines, in the pines, 
where the sun never shines
And I shivered where the cold winds blow.</pre>
