<h3>Los Angeles, Aug 2, 1988</h3>

<p>In some verses the final Em is played as an Em9 (022032) or as Em7 (022030)</p>

<pre>      Em             C                          Em
'Twas in the town of Jacksboro in the year of '73 
       Em                 C                          Em
When a well-known, famous drover came a-steppin' up to me 
        Em                   C                             G  C/g G  /f#
Saying, How do you do, young cowboy, and how'd you like to go 
    Em               C                                   Em
And spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo </pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>Me being out of work right then, to this drover I did say
This going out on the buffalo range depends upon your pay 
But if you will pay good wages, transportation to and fro 
I think I might go with you all the way to the buffalo </pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>I will pay good wages, and transportation too 
If you'll agree to work for me until the season's through 
But if you do get homesick and try to run away                 Em9
You'll starve to death on the buffalo range and also lose your pay.</pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>With all this flattering talking, he signed up quite a train 
Some ten or twelve in number, some able-bodied men 
Our trip it was a pleasant one as we hit the westward road 
'Til we reached old Boggy Creek in the range of the buffalo</pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>There our pleasures ended and our troubles they begun 
A lightning storm it hit us and it made the cattle run 
Got all full of stickers from the cactus that did grow 
Indians [/outlaws] waiting to pick us off from the hills of Mexico </pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>[tape cut]</pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>Our souls were cased in a buffalo [weed], and our hearts were cased in steel.
The hardships on the prairie, they make your poor heart [real]
couldn't drink the water, oh boys it was no [go(?)]
of us on the buffalo range in the hills of the buffalo.</pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>Well, the working season ended but the drover would not pay 
He said &quot;You boys went and drunk too much, you're all in debt to me&quot; 
But the cowboys never did hear of such a thing as a bankrupt law 
So we left that drover's bones to bleach in the hills of the buffalo</pre>
</div><div align="left">

<pre>Now we crossed Pease River, and homeward we are bound
No more on the buffalo range will we ever be found
Go home to our wives and sweethearts and tell others not to go
For God has forsaken the buffalo range and the damned old buffalo.</pre>
