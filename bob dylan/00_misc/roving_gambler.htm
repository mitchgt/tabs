<p><tt>G<br>
I am a rovin' gambler, I've gambled all around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
Wherever I meet with a deck of cards<br>
&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
G<br>
I lay my money down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(C)&nbsp;&nbsp; G<br>
(I Lay my money down; Lay my money down.)</tt>
<br><tt></tt>&nbsp;
<pre>I gambled up in Washington, gambled over in Spain
I'm on my way to Frisco town&nbsp;
to knock down my last game
(knock down my last game; knock down my last game)

I had not been in 'Frisco, many more days than three
I fell in love with a pretty little girl
And she fell in love with me
(Fell in love with me; Fell in love with me.)

She took me in her parlor, she cooled me with a fan
She whispered low in her mama's ear
&quot;I love this gamblin' man.&quot;
(&quot;Love this gamelin' man.&quot;; &quot;Love this gamblin' man.&quot;)

&quot;Daughter, Oh! dear daughter, how could you treat me so?
And leave your dear old mother
And with a gambler go?&quot;
(&quot;With a gambler go?&quot;; &quot;With a gambler go?&quot;)

&quot;Mother, Oh dear mother, I'll tell you if I can
If you ever see my face again,&nbsp;
I'll be with the gamblin' man&quot;
(&quot;be with the gamblin' man&quot;; &quot;be with the gamblin' man&quot;)

I left her in 'Frisco, I went up to Maine
then I met with a gamblin' man
and then we got into a poker game
(Got into a poker game; We got into a poker game.)

He put some money in the pot, passed the cards around
I saw him deal from the bottom of the deck
So I shot the gambler down
(Shot the gambler down; Shot the gambler down.)

Now I'm down in prison, I got a number for a name
The warden said as he closed the door
You've gambled your last game
(Gambled your last game; Gambled your last game.)</pre>
