<pre>   G                Eb7
We three, we're all alone,
G          (F# F) E
Living in a memory,
   Am       D(9)        G   G#o  Am   D(7-9)
My echo, my shadow, and me.
   G                  Eb	7
We three, we're not a crowd,
G             (F# F) E
We're not even company,
   Am       D           G     C/g   G   G7
My echo, my shadow, and me.

G7
What good is the moon,

The silvery moon,
     C(maj7)
That shines above?
  A7
I walk with my shadow,

I talk with my echo
    D9                 D7
But where is the one I love?
</pre>

<pre>   G                     Eb7
We three, we'll wait for you
G          F# F E 
Even 'til eternity,
   Am       D7          G     
My echo, my shadow, and me.</pre>
