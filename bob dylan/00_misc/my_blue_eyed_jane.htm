<h1>My Blue Eyed Jane</h1>

<p>Words and music Jimmie Rodgers<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan on <em>The Songs of Jimmie Rodgers - A Tribute</em> (1997)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The key may seem awkward, but he seems to have turned from &quot;C- or G-shape chords
with capo&quot; to &quot;E- and A-shape barré chords&quot; these days, and so the key
doesn't matter that much. What may still be an argument for a capo on the 2nd fret, is
that the second chord sounds more like a D-shape chord than an E-shape, with the 3rd on
the highest string. Just to be sure, I've appended such a version at the end.</p>

<pre>    B             E             B    F#        B
The sweetest girl in the world is my blue eyed Jane
   F#                G#m          C#                 F#
We fell in love like turtle doves while the moon was shining down
  B                 E                  B       F#          B  
I asked her then, I asked her when the wedding bells would ring
    C#                                                        F#
She said, &quot;Oh dear, it seems so queer, that this could happen here.&quot;</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>           B
You are my little pal, and I've never known a sweeter gal
             F#               B
My blue eyed Jane, I love you so
             B
And when the sun goes down, and the shadows are creeping all over town
                    F#                 B
Just meet me in the lane, my blue eyed Jane</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Janie dear, listen here, I've come to say farewell
The world is drear without you dear, and now I cannot linger here
I'm going away this very day, oh please come go with me
I'll be sad and blue wantin' you, longin' all day through</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>My little blue eyed Jane, you'll always be the same sweet thing
I know you'll never change, I love you so
And when the sun goes down, and the shadows are creeping over town
Then I'll come back again, my blue eyed Jane.</pre>
  <pre>And when the sun goes down, and a shadows are creeping all over town
Then I'll come back again, my blue eyed Jane.</pre>
