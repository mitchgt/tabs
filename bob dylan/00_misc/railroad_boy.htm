<h1>Railroad Boy</h1>

<p>Trad.<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan and Joan Baez during the second Rolling Thunder Revue (1976), incl.
the <em>Hard Rain </em>TV special<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Dylan plays uncapoed, with the chords Am and F, whereas Baez plays finger-picking style
with a capo on the 5th fret, where she produces the little interlude, that is what makes
this song something special (aside from their singing, of course). The rhythms vary a bit,
but this is in essence what she plays:</p>

<pre>           Em
She went upstairs to make her bed.
            C                  Em
And not one word to her mother said.
                            
Her mother she went upstairs too,
                    C                          Em
Saying &quot;Daughter oh daughter, what's troubling you?&quot;

Oh mother oh mother I cannot tell.
It's that railroad boy that looks so well.
He's courted me my life away.
And now at home I long to stay.

There is a place in yonder town
where my love goes and he sits there down.
And he takes a strange girl on his knee,
And he tells to her what he won't tell me.

Her father he came home from work,
Saying', &quot;Where's my daughter, she seems so hurt&quot;
He went upstairs to give her hope,
And he found her hanging by the rope.

He took a knife and he cut her down.
And on her boossom these words he found:
&quot;Go dig my grave both wide and deep.
Put a marble stone at my head and feet.

And on my grave put a snowwhite dove
To tell the world that I died of love.&quot;</pre>

She went upstairs to make her bed.
            F                  Am
And not one word to her mother said.
                            
Her mother she went upstairs too,
                    F                          am
Saying &quot;Daughter oh daughter, what's troubling you?&quot;</pre>
