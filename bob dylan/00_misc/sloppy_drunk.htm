<title>Sloppy Drunk</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Sloppy Drunk</h1>

<p>Ascribed to Jimmy Rogers (but neither the lyrics nor the song structure have 
much in common with Rogers' version)<br>
Recorded by Bob Dylan during the Bromberg Sessions, early/mid June 1992<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (thanks to esmith for corrections and details)</p>

<hr>

<p>The version played here seems to be based on David Bromberg's version, which 
differs substantially from Jimmy Rogers's (the bluesman, not the country artist 
Jimmie Rodgers), who again took some &quot;inspiration&quot; (whatever that means in the 
blues world) from Sonny Boy Williamson I and his &quot;Sloppy Drunk Blues&quot;.</p>

<p>The Eb7 in the turnaround could be played xx1323, x6564x, or, simpler, and 
perhaps even more correctly, xx1003.</p>
