<h1>I Will Love Him</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan<br>
Performed live by Dylan in Toronto, April 19, 1980<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem. Lyric transcription leans heavily on discussions at
<a href="http://pool.dylantree.com">pool.dylantree.com</a></p>

<hr>

<p>Capo 1st fret (sounding key Db major)</p>

<p>It varies somewhat what is the first bass tone in each bar in the refrain, C 
or D. In the introduction, it leans more towards C, but after the verses, where 
it is prepared by the A chord, it is more unequivocally a D, as the root in a 
Dm7 chord. The second measure of the tab below is a suggestion of how to get 
both, without loosing too much of any of them.</p>

And disappeared [like when he taught]
