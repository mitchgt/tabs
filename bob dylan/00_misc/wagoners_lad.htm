<h1>Wagoner's Lad</h1>

<p>Trad.<br>
As performed by Bob Dylan, Oct 19 1988 <a

Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>The version from Oct 19 1988 sounds one half step lower, but it is definitely played
with the chords below. Either the tape is slow, or the guitars are tuned down (not
likely).</p>

<p>Cadd2 = x32030 or x32033</p>

<p>The last line of each verse is played (more or less):</p>

<pre>  Cadd2               G     C/g    G
  :     .     .       :     .      .

  slave...    rest..  life</pre>

<pre>   G                      C/g      G     C/g G
Oh hard is the fortune of all womankind 
     G                       G /b   /c D    Dsus4 D
It's always controlled, it's always confined 
   D              G             /b   /c D
Controlled by her parents until she's a wife
     Cadd2 /b /a  /c /b   /a      /c   /b /a  G
Then slave to her husband for the rest of her life 

She is a poor girl, and her fortune is sad 
always been courted by the wagoner's lad 
He courted her truly both night and by day 
But now he is a-loaded and a-going away 

Your parents don't like me they say I'm too poor 
They say I'm not worthy to enter your door 
But I work for a living, my money's my own 
And them that don't like it can leave me alone 

My horses ain't hungry, and they don't need your hay 
Come sit down beside me for as long as you stay 
I'd go to Montana if the moon showed any light,
But my pony can't travel this dark road tonight.</pre>

<pre>I once had a sweetheart and her age was sixteen
She's the flower of Belton and the rose of Seline.
But her parents was against me, now she is the same,
If I'd writ on your book, love, you just blot out my name.</pre>

<pre>Hard is the fortune of all womankind 
It's always controlled, and it's always confined 
Controlled by her parents until she's a wife
Then slave to her husband for the rest of her life.</pre>
