<pre>G             D   C        Em
 You speak to me   in sign language 
                D                   Em
As I'm eatin' a sandwich in a small cafe 
C                G
 At a quarter to three. 

But I can't respond to your sign language. 
You're taking advantage, bringing me down 
Can't you make any sound? 

'Twas there by the bakery, surrounded by fakery 
Tell her my story, still I'm still there 
Does she know I still care? </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>[instr. verse, followed by a verse sung by Dylan]</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Link Wray was playin' on a jukebox I was payin' 
For the words I was sayin' so misunderstood 
He didn't do me no good. 

You speak to me in sign language 
As I'm eatin' a sandwich in a small cafe 
At a quarter to three. 

But I can't respond to your sign language. 
You're taking advantage, bringing me down 
Can't you make any sound? </pre>
