<h1>Searching For A Soldier's Grave</h1>

<p>Written by Jim Anglin (1913-1987), who sold the copyrights to Roy Acuff (this was the
case even with <a href="this_world_cant_stand_long.htm">This World Can't Stand Long</a>);
it's been recorded by The Blue Sky Boys, Hank Williams, et al., and by Ralph
Stanley&nbsp;(on <em>Pray For The Boys</em>), which is probably the source&nbsp;of Dylan's
version.<br>
.<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan on various occasions since the first performance in Portland, OR,
Jun 15 2000<br>
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem (who personally thinks it's a rather silly
song...) (although Hank Williams considered it &quot;one of the purdyest songs I reckon
anybody ever wrote&quot; - &quot;all for poppa during WWII&quot;)</p>

You ask me, stranger, why I make this journey
C                                           G
Why I cross three thousand miles of rolling waves.
     C                                    F
Like so many others my love was killed in action.
C           G                 C
So I'm here searching for his grave.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Somewhere among the many thousand
Of all the Americans who died, true and brave,
That's where I know I'll find him resting
So I'm here searching for his grave.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Beside each crossmark there all around me
I'll kneel down and gladly say a prayer
For all the dear loved ones home across the ocean
Whose hearts like mine lie buried over here.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Somewhere among the many dozens
Of all the Americans who died true and brave
That's where I know I'll find him resting
So I'm here searching for his grave.</pre>
