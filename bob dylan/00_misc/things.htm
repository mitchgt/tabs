<pre>Gm
A worried man with a worried mind 
Cm
No one in front of me and nothing behind 
Gm                                               D7
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne 
Gm
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes 
Cm
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies 
    Gm                           D7   Gm
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train 
Eb                              D7          Gm
Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose 
Eb                                             D7
Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose </pre>

<pre>Gm
People are crazy and times are strange 
    Cm
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range 
Gm                   D7          Gm
I used to care but - things have changed. 
</pre>

<p>This place ain't doin' me any good <br>
I'm in the wrong town, I should've been in Hollywood <br>
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move <br>
Gonna take dancin' lessons, do the jitterbug rag <br>
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag <br>
Only a fool in here would think he got anythin' to prove <br>
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too <br>
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through <br>
People are crazy and times are strange <br>
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range <br>
I used to care but - things have changed. </p>

<p>I've been walkin' forty miles of bad road <br>
If the Bible is right the world will explode <br>
I'm tryin' to get as far away from myself as I can <br>
Some things are too hot to touch <br>
The human mind can only stand so much <br>
You can't win with a losing hand <br>
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet <br>
Puttin' her in a wheelbarrow and wheelin' her down the street <br>
People are crazy and times are strange <br>
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range <br>
I used to care but - things have changed. </p>

<p>I hurt easy, I just don't show it <br>
You can hurt someone and not even know it <br>
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity <br>
Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high <br>
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie <br>
I'm in love with a woman that don't even appeal to me <br>
Mr. Jinx and miss Lucy they jumped in a lake <br>
I'm not that eager to make a mistake <br>
People are crazy and times are strange <br>
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range <br>
I used to care but - things have changed. </p>

<p>The song can of course be played with a capo on the 3rd fret:</p>

<pre>Em
A worried man with a worried mind 
Am
No one in front of me and nothing behind 
Em                                               B7
There's a woman on my lap and she's drinking champagne 
Em
Got white skin, got assassin's eyes 
Am
I'm looking up into the sapphire tempered skies 
    Em                           B7   Em
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train 
C                               B7          Em
Standin' on the gallows with my head in the noose 
C                                              B7
Any minute now I'm expectin' all hell to break loose </pre>
