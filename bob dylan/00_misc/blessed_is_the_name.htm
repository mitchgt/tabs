<title>Blessed Is The Name</title>

<h1>Blessed Is The Name</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan<br>
Performed during the 1979-80 gospel tours.<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (but see alternate lyric transcriptions below)</p>

<hr>

<p>Ironically, this is probably the song with which Dylan has made the most 
energetic attempts at a sing-along kind of rapport with the audience, but - it 
doesn't really work, does it...?<br>
The lyrics for the verses - well, I made an attempt. The transcriptions below 
are a mixture of phonetic and semantic. I welcome corrections, as always.</p>

<pre>E
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
           *)                                              *) Briefly A, or stay on E
Wisdom and might are his                x2 or x3
    A            B
Are his, yes are his
E [or n.c.]
Blessed is the name of the Lord forever
           *)
Wisdom and might are his                x2

<pre>When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other 		
He's God all by himself alone</pre>

<pre>Well to the just he will be faithful
[let it rain fire and] brimstone down				
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town</pre>

<pre>19/11 '79</pre>

<pre>When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
With him there is no other 		
He's God all by himself alone</pre>

<pre>Well to the just he will be faithful
[hittin' on/he won't] drive you out of town 
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town</pre>

<pre>20/11 '79</pre>

<pre>When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other 		
He's God all by himself alone</pre>

<pre>Way back down in the days of Noah
He'd drive you out of the town
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town</pre>

<pre>21/11 '79</pre>

<pre>Well [...]
Sit up high on a throne
He will not share his glory
He's God all by himself alone</pre>

<pre>[Well jumpin'] in the days of Noah
[sending] fire and brimstone down
But he did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah
Till Lot was safely out of the town</pre>

<pre>[Well in Eden on] the days of power
King on his own time clock
Like him there is no other 		
And, hey, he will not be mocked </pre>

<pre>16/1 '80</pre>

<pre>When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other 		
He's God all by himself alone</pre>

<pre>Well, in the time by the days of Noah
[...] the dark
But not one drop of water fell
Till Noah was safely in the ark</pre>

<pre>23/1 '80</pre>

<pre>When he move his face upon the water
Sit up high on a throne
Like him there is no other 		
He's God all by himself alone</pre>

<pre>Listen, back in the days of Noah
[... faithful of the/after] dark
But not one drop of water fell
Till Noah was safely in the ark</pre>

Blessed is the name of the Lord forever 
Wisdom and might are His 

Well He moved His face on the water 
He sits up high on the throne 
Like Him there is no other 
He is God all by Himself alone 

...
... 
... singing the blues 
And He can renew your mind 

Well He ... upon the peoples 
... He's got His own time clock 
He will not share His glory 
And He will not be mocked 

Way back in the days of Noah 
They found Him faithful at the dock 
Remember not one drop of water fell 
Til Noah was safely in the ark 

Well He always will forewarn you 
Before He rains fire and brimstone down 
He did not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah 
Until Lot was safely out of town 

He made the mountains 
He made the sea 
He made the way of salvation 
for you and me
