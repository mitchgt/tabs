<pre>      F            Bb/d           C
Been away, haven't seen you in a while
           Bb             Dm      C    Dm
How've you been, have you changed your style?
            F              Bb/d              C
What do you think, have we grown up differently?
               Bb                   Dm   C    Dm
Don't feel the same, seems like you lost your feel

<blockquote>
  <pre>         Bb    C   F
So let's leave it alone
       Bb        C      F
Cos we don't see eye to eye
     (/g)      F/a      Bb
There ain't no good guy
               F/a     Bb
There ain't no bad guy
        (/c) Dm             Bb      C   F
There's only you and me and we just disagree.</pre>

Dm  C/e F</pre>

<pre>I'm goin back to a place that's far away
How 'bout you, have you got a place to stay
Why should I care, I'm just trying to get along
We were friends, now it's the end of our love song.</pre>
