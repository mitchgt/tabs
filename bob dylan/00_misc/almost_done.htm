<h1>Almost Done</h1>

<p>Words (?) and music Bob Dylan<br>
Played, more or less improvised, on the Verona and Beverly Theatre rehearsals, May 1984<br>
Tabbed and transcribed (sort of) by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>It seemed meaningless to try and transcribe the mumbling on the Beverly Theatre version
(May 23). Verona was a little less meaningless...</p>

It's already done
for light and blue</pre>

Gonna be lucky,

Already new

or say goodbye
