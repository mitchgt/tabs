<h1>On A Rainy Afternoon/Does She Need Me?/I Can't Leave Her Behind</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan (and Robbie Robertson, I assume)<br>
Filmed in an unknown hotel room during the 1966 tour, and saved for posterity on <em>Eat
The Document</em><br>
Lyrics transcribed by Tobias Levander and Arild Langseth (&quot;I Can't Leave Her
Behind&quot;).<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>This is one of the most charming tunes that Dylan has never written - too bad he didn't
finish it. It is also a fascinating study in the development of song, and in Dylan's
composing technique. I assume that the version called &quot;On a rainy afternoon&quot; or
&quot;Does she need me?&quot; comes first - the &quot;twice as slow&quot; version with the
duple time rhythm that grows out of this, is what appears in &quot;I can't leave her
behind&quot;.</p>

<p>Dylan's guitar is tuned in drop C (C-A-d-g-b-e'), capoed on the fifth fret, Robbie's is
in standard tuning.</p>

<p>The main transcription uses Robbie's guitar. Bbmaj7 = xx8765</p>
