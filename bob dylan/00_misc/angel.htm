<pre>G                   Bm          C                G
If you had not have fallen then I would not have found you 
C            D                G
Angel flying too close to the ground 
G                 Bm              C         G        
I patched up your broken wing and hung around for a while 
          A                                   D      D7
trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>
   G               G7
So leave me if you need to, 
C            A
I will still remember 
G            D                G
Angel flying too close to the ground. </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>  G                               C
I knew someday that you would fly away 
A                                    D
for love&#146;s the greatest healer to be found </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>So leave me if you need to, 
I will still remember 
Angel flying too close to the ground </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Fly on fly on past the speed of sound 
I&#146;d rather see you up than see you down </pre>

  <pre>So leave me if you need to,
