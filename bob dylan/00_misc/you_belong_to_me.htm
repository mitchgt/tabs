<p>From <a href="http://www.users.wineasy.se/olof.bjorner/941.htm">Olof's files</a>:
&quot;Dylan sings a song from 1952 called You Belong To Me, written by Pee Wee King, Redd
Stewart and Chilton Price. It's an acoustic solo recording that could very well have been
recorded at the same time as Good As I Been To You or World Gone Wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Some comments on the tab and the song: 

<ul>
  <li>The intro is of course a general outline of the melody, which means that it (or a
    simpler version of it) can be played along with the verses. The interludes follow the same
    basic pattern as well. Figure out the variations yourself... :-)</li>
  <li>The dots in the tab always indicate the beats of the measure (quarter notes), the commas
    the subdivisions of the beats (eighth-notes).</li>
  <li>The indicated hammer-ons are quite tricky if one tries to do them right, but the basic
    idea (of the whole piece) is of course to strum the chords above the tab, and occasionally
    getting to a chord a little &quot;too early&quot;, if you see what I mean. </li>
  <li>The slide up to the Dm' chord actually begins one half-beat earlier, i.e. on the last
    half-beat in the previous measure.</li>
  <li>All in all the intro is a great sample of Dylan's inimitable acoustic melody-strumming
    playing style a la <em>Good As I Been To You </em>(just compare with <em><a href="http://bobdylan.com/songs/albert.html">Frankie and Albert</a>, </em>e.g.)<em>.</em></li>
  <li>Just one more thing before I'll let you go on playing: The song--both the tune and the
    text--reminds quite a lot of <em><a href="../38_toom/feelmylove.htm">Make You Feel My Love</a>.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Capo 4th fret (sounding key E major)</p>

<pre>C                  Em
 See the pyramids along the Nile

Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me</pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>[more instrumental verses, over the following dialogue (in a southern accent), which
  you could let some friends take, while you finish off the song:</p>
  <p>Woman: &quot;I just want to tell you I love you, and I miss you. Don't forget about me.
  You won't forget about me?&quot;</p>
  <p>Man: &quot;I won't forget about you. It's cool. No matter where he takes you,
  Timbouktou, it don't matter, because it's fate. Know? Nobody can stop fate. Nobody
  can.&quot;]<br>
