<pre>C          
I was riding number 9,
        F          C
heading south from Carolina.
                G               C
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow.

Got in trouble, had to roam,
        F             C
left my girl, left my home.
                G               C
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow.</pre>

<pre>
       F       
Just a kid, acting smart,
           C
I went and broke my baby's heart.
              D            G
I guess I was too young to know.
             C
They took me off that Georgia Main 
              F             C
and locked me to a ball and chain.
                G               C
I heard that lo-onesome whistle blow.</pre>

<pre>
All I do is sit and cry
as the evening train goes by.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
I'll be locked here in this cell
till my body's just a shell
and my head turns whiter than snow.
I'll never see that girl of mine
'cos I'm in Georgia doing time.
I heard that lonesome whistle blow.
