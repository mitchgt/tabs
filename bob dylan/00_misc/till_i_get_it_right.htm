<pre>C   
I'll just keep on 

falling in love 
D/c
till I get it right
F         
 Right now I'm like 
G
 a wounded bird
C               Gm7  C7
 Hungry for the sky
F
 But if I try my way, 
        G    (E7/g#)
and try long enough,
    C7/Bb                 F
I'm bound to learn how to fly
D7/f#
 So I'll just keep fallin', 
F           G    
 fallin' in love 
C       F/c    C
 Till I get it right</pre>

<pre>My door of love 
has opened out 
More times than in
And I'm either a fool, 
or a wiser woman
To open it again
Cause I'll never know 
what's beyond the mountain
till I reach the other side
So I'll just keep on, 
falling in love
Till I get it right</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Gm7
 If practice makes perfect, 
C7                   F                 Ab
 then I'm as perfect as I'll ever be
D    
So I'll just keep on, 
F           G
 falling in love
C             D/c
Till I get it right
F       G11    C

           D/c
fallin' in love 
                      F     G11 
I'm gonna keep fallin', 
C
till I, till I, till I get it right
C                     D/c
[I'll keep falling in love,
