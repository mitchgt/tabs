<h1>To Fall In Love With You</h1>

<p>words (?!) and music (!) Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded during the <em>Hearts of Fire </em>sessions 27-28 aug 1986<br>
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Your words aren't clear. I turned this song down for a long time, thinking that wasn't
worth the effort transcribing it, and that it's a shame that such a beautiful tune has
such undecipherable lyrics, probably improvised on the spot. But I couldn't resist it, of
course. Most of the lines below are just reasonably close approximations to sounds that
could have made sense in a better world. I don't even think there is a word like
&quot;deverthisse&quot; in English, nor can I think of a context that will make the phrase
&quot;How can the doors a trust on a nail&quot; make sense. Oh well . . .</p>

<p>At least the music is a delight. The tune is in B major, but for the first eight lines
the tune isn't anywhere near a B chord.&nbsp; It would have made a beautiful song had he
bothered to finish it--certainly the best song from that soundtrack. It is also quite
similar to <a href="almost_done.htm">&quot;Almost done&quot;</a>, another discarded
gem-to-be.</p>

<pre>The day is dark
our time is right
day in the night
deep in the night
I came [dev] be back
I hear-a my-a surprise
I see it in you live
I knew it in your eyes
well I feel your love
and I feel no shame
I can't unleash your horde
I call your name
What were to me
What can I do?
To fall in love 
To fall in love 
To fall in love

<pre>It just rolls
upon the sand
[deverthisse] now
I made the man
can make you feel
what I can find
I know it in my days
Ah in my dreary mind
Oh will ages roll
Will ages fly
I hear your name
where angel lie.
What do I know?
for to come it's true
To fall in love 
To fall in love 
To fall in love 
with you</pre>

<pre>How can the doors
a trust on a nail  
how can I be surprised
of most everything
ah in the distant road
I can['t] be the same
I feel no love
I kill no shame
I can't watch the bay
Out on my an own
we've a destined man
I came atist it all
[I didn't] I could find
Where I could go
To fall in love 
To fall in love 
To fall in love 
with you</pre>
