Well, I'm a-tellin' it, people, Lord, you can take it from me. </pre>

<pre>Lord, I've seen better days, but I'm puttin' up with these. 
Lord, I've seen better days, I'm puttin' up with these. 
Well, there's too many people, they're all too hard to please. </pre>

<pre>'Cause I was born in the country she thinks I'm easy to use, 
'Cause I was born in the country she thinks I'm easy to use. 
'Cause I was born in the country you know I'm easy to lose. </pre>

<pre>I gave you sugar for sugar, you want salt for salt. 
I gave you sugar for sugar, but you want salt for salt, 
And if you can't get along, honey, it's your own damn fault. </pre>

<pre>Sometimes I'm thinkin' you're too good to die, 
Sometimes I'm thinkin' you're too good to die, 
Other times I'm thinkin' you ought to be buried alive. </pre>

<pre>These are the bluest blues that a man could ever have, 
These are the bluest blues a man could ever have. 
These are the darnest hard-luck blues a man could brag.</pre>
