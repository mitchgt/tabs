<pre>    G               G+   
Go ahead, drive the nails through my hand
C                     G
Laugh at me where you stand. 
G                G+
Go ahead, say it isn't me 
        C                 G
But the day will come and you will see.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>            G  /f C/e
'Cause I'll rise again
D                 D11              G      (D)
Ain't no power on earth can tie me down 
          G  /f C/e
Yes, I'll rise again 
D                   D11           G
Death can't keep me buried in the ground.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Go ahead, come on and mock my name
My love for you is still the same 
Go ahead and try to bury me 
But very soon I will be free.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on earth can tie me down 
Yes, I'll rise again 
Death can't keep me buried in the ground.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Go ahead, say I'm dead and gone 
You will see that you were wrong. 
Go ahead, try to hide the sun 
And you all will see that I'm the one.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on earth can tie me down 
Yes, I'll rise again 
Death can't keep me buried in the ground.

'Cause I'll rise again
Ain't no power on earth can tie me down 
Yes, I'll rise again 
Death can't keep me buried in the ground.
Death can't keep me buried in the ground.</pre>
