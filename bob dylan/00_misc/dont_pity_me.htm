<h1>Don't Pity Me</h1>

<p>Performed by Bob Dylan in Joliette, Quebec, July 31 1989 (a one-off).<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem and Jamie Lovinger</p>

<p>On my tape (thanks, Jamie), it sounds as if he actually plays it in F# major. On the
other hand, the final chord sounds very much like a G shape chord, which is also much
easier to play. I append a version in G major at the end.</p>

<p>The lyrics are full of blanks - the word within brackets are not really meaningful
suggestions, just words that sound like what he's singing, mainly to have something to
place the chords on...</p>
