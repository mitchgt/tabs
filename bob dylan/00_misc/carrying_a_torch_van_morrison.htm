<pre>[instr. verse]</pre>

<pre>C               G/b            Am   F
 I'm carryin' a torch for you
C         G     F
 I'm carryin' a torch
C              G/b         Am             F
 You don't know, you don't know what it's worth
C        G               C
 To keep carryin' a torch 


Flame of love it burns so bright
That is my desire
Keep on liftin' me, liftin' me up
Higher and higher </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>G7
You're the keeper of the flame
F                      C
 And you burn so bright
G7
 why don't we, why don't we re-connect
F                         G7
 And move up into the light </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>
I've been going to and fro on this and that
cause I'm still carryin' a torch
You must know, You must know what it's worth
To keep carryin' a torch </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Baby you're the keeper of the flame
And you burn so bright
 why don't we, why don't we re-connect
And move all up into the light </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I've been calling you on the phone
Cause I'm carryin' a torch
I can do it all on my own
Keep carryin' a torch 

I'm carryin' a torch for you, baby
I'm carryin' a torch
You don't know, you don't know what it's worth
To keep carryin' a torch 

I've been carryin', I've been carryin' a torch for you, baby
I keep carryin' a torch
[You don't know, you don't know what it's worth]
                        F        G   C     
Cause I, I'm carryin' a torch.</pre>
