<h1>That Lucky Old Sun</h1>

<p>Haven Gillespie &amp; Beasley Smith<br>
Played by Bob Dylan on various occasions during the Never Ending Tour. <br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The lyrics are the original; Dylan sings his own version from time to time... Even the
tune itself has gone through some transformations.</p>

<pre>C                  Em
 Up in the mornin', out on the job
F                    G      C
 Work like the devil for my pay.
         F                 C            F
But that lucky old sun has nothin' to do
    C/g         G           C       Csus4
But roll around heaven all day.

Had a fuss with my woman, an' I toil for my kids,
An' I sweat 'til I'm wrinkled and gray,
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around heaven all day.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Am        Em              F       C
Oh, Lord above, don't you hear me cryin'
F         G               C
Tears are rollin' down my eyes.
Am        Em    F             C      
Send in a cloud with a silver linin',
D7             G   (Gsus4 G)
Take me to paradise.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Show me that river, Take me across, 
wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun give me nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day.</pre>
