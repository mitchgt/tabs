<pre>                           C
Take the ribbons from your hair
                         F
Shake it lose and let it fall
                         G
Lay it soft against your skin
                        C
Like the shadows on the wall
</pre>

<pre>Come and lay down by my side
Till the early morning bright
All I'm taking is your time
Help me make it through the night

  <pre>                              F
I don't care what's right or wrong
                    C
I don't try to understand
                     D
Let the devil take tomorrow
                     G    (/f /e /d  or   F Em Dm)
For tonight I need a friend</pre>

<pre>Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
I don't care what's right or wrong
Help me make it through the night</pre>

<pre>I don't care what's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
And today is also dead and gone
Help me make it through the night.</pre>
