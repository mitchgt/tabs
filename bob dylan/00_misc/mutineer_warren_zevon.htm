<h1>Mutineer</h1>

<p>Written by Warren Zevon<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan during the fall tour 2002<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Below are two versions, with different capo positions. Since Zevon plays the song with
a keyboard arrangement, the chords are only suggestions.</p>

<p>Dylan is generally faithful to Zevon's version, with two small exceptions: he drops the
C#m/g# in the second line, and he simplifies the bass run in the refrain lines to: </p>

<pre>E/g# - A - B - E</pre>
