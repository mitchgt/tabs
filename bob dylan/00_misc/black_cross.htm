<h1>Black Cross (Hezekiah Jones)</h1>

<p>Written by Joseph S. Newman, popularized by Lord Buckley (see their versions below)<br>
Dylan's version has the story from these, but the delivery is his own. <br>
Recorded on the third <a href="gaslight_tapes.htm">Gaslight Tape</a><br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The verses that Dylan divides this into, are marked by two figures: first a short turn
from G to C and back again, then a shift to D, where he stays for a shorter or longer
time, &quot;talkin' blues&quot; fashion.</p>

<p>The turns from G to C are played: </p>

<pre>| G . . C | G . . etc</pre>

<p>The shift from G to D is played like this:</p>

<pre>  G                 D
  :   .   .   .     :   . 
|---3---3---3-----|---2---

<pre>G       C G</pre>

<pre>                                          G-D
This is the story of Hezekiah Jones... 

Hezekiah Jones lived in a place... in Arkansas.
             G       C G
He never had too much, 
                        G-D
except he had some land,

An' he had a couple of hogs and things like that.</pre>

<pre>G
He never had much money
       C       G
But he spent what he did make as fast as he made it,
                                   G-D
So it never really mattered that he had much money.</pre>

<pre>                        G  C G
But in a cupboard there, 
                          G-D
He kept in the cupboard... 

he kept in the cupboard books,
                                        G    C G
He called the books his &quot;rainy season.&quot; </pre>

<pre>                                                          C G
The white folks around the county there talked about Hezekiah...
     G-D
They... said, &quot;Well... old Hezekiah, he's harmless enough, 

but the way I see it he better put down them goddam books,
                                                   G     C G
Readin' ain't no good, for an ignorant nigger.&quot; </pre>

<pre>G-D</pre>

<pre>One day the white man's preacher came around
                                       G
Knockin' on doors, knockin' on all the doors in the county, 
                  C      G
He knocked on Hezekiah's door.

He says, &quot;Hezekiah, you believe in the Lord?&quot;
   /c          /b                    D
Hezekiah says, &quot;Well, I don't know, I never really SEEN the Lord,

I can't say, yes, I do...&quot; </pre>

<pre>              G
He says, &quot;Hezekiah, you believe in the Church?&quot; 
              C           G
Hezekiah says, &quot;Well, the Church is divided, ain't they,
      C           G
And... they can't make up their minds.
                      D
I'm just like them, I can't make up mine either.&quot; </pre>

<pre>              G                 
He says, &quot;Hezekiah, you believe 
                 C    G                D-G
that if a man is good Heaven is his last reward?&quot;
                        G-D
Hezekiah says, &quot;I'm good... good as my neighbor.&quot; </pre>

<pre>                      G                                 C-G
&quot;You don't believe in nothin',&quot; said the white man's preacher,
                         C /b D
You don't believe in nothin'!&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, I do,&quot; says Hezekiah,

&quot;I believe that a man should be indebted to his neighbor

Not for the reward of Heaven or fear of hellfire.&quot; </pre>

<pre>                    G
&quot;But you don't understand,&quot; said the white man's preacher,
                  C                         G           G-D
&quot;There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked...&quot; </pre>

<pre>                                             /e-f# G
Then they hung Hezekiah high as a pigeon.
                                        C   /b-a  G      D
White folks around there said, &quot;Well... he had it comin' 

'Cause the son-of-a-bitch never had no religion!&quot;</pre>

<pre>G     C  /b-a G</pre>

<p><b>Black Cross</b> <br>
Joseph S. Newman </p>

<p>Hezekiah Jones of Hogback County <br>
Lived on a hill in a weather-beaten hovel <br>
And all that he owned was a two-acre plot <br>
And a bed and some books and a hoe and a shovel. </p>

<p>Hezekiah, black as the soil he was hoeing, <br>
Worked pretty hard to make ends meet; <br>
Raised what he ate, with a few cents over <br>
To buy corn likker that he drank down neat, </p>

<p>And a few cents more that he put in the cupboard <br>
Against what he called &quot;de rainy season,&quot; <br>
But he never got to save more'n two or three dollars <br>
Till he gave it away for this or that reason. </p>

<p>The white folks around knew old Hezekiah... <br>
&quot;Harmless enough, but the way I figger <br>
He better lay off'n them goddam books, <br>
'Cause readin' ain't good fer an ignorant nigger.&quot; </p>

<p>Reverend Green, of the white man's church, <br>
Finally got around to &quot;comin' ovah <br>
To talk with you-all about the Pearly Kingdom <br>
An' to save yo' soul fer the Lawd Jehovah!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;D'ya b'lieve in the Lawd?&quot; asked the white man's preacher. <br>
Hezekiah puckered his frosty brow, <br>
&quot;Well I can't say 'yes,' so I ain't gonna say it, <br>
Caze I ain't SEEN de Lawd....nowhere....no-how.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;D'ya b'lieve in Heaven?&quot; asked the white man's preacher, <br>
&quot;Where you go, if you're good, fer yer last rewa'hd?&quot; <br>
&quot;Ah'm good,&quot; said Hezikiah, &quot;good as Ah'm able, <br>
But Ah don't expect nothin' from Heaven OR the Lawd.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;D'ya b'lieve in the Church?&quot; asked the white man's preacher. <br>
Hezekiah said, &quot;Well de Church is divided; <br>
Ef they can't agree, than Ah cain't neither... <br>
Ah'm like them....Ah ain't decided.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You don't b'lieve nothin',&quot; roared the white man's preacher. <br>
&quot;Oh yes Ah does,&quot; said old Hezikiah, <br>
&quot;Ah b'lieve that a man's beholden to his heighbash <br>
Widout de hope of Heaven or de fear o' hell's fiah.&quot; </p>

<p>There's a lot of good ways for a man to be wicked... <br>
They hung Hezikiah as high as a pidgeon, <br>
And the nice folks around said, &quot;He had it comin' <br>
