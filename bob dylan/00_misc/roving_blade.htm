<pre>         G                 F              C
In Newry town, where I was bred and born, 
G                     F           G
Stephen's Green now I lie in scorn. 
            C                 F         C
I served my time there to the saddlers' trade, 
             G     F      C
And I always was a roving blade. </pre>

<pre>
At seventeen I took a wife, 
And I loved her dearer than I loved my life; 
And for to keep her both neat and gay, 
I went a-robbing on the King's highway. 

I never robbed any poor man yet, 
Nor any tradesman did I beset;*)
But I robbed lords and their ladies fair, 
And brought their jewels to my heart's delight. 

To Covent Garden I made my way, 
With my dear wife for to see the play; 
Lord Fielding's men did me pursue, 
And taken was I by the cursed crew. 

My father cried, &quot;My darling son.&quot; 
My wife she cried, &quot;I am undone.&quot; 
My mother tore her white locks and cried 
that in the cradle I should have died. 

When I am dead and in my grave 
A flashy funeral pray let me have; 
Six highwaymen for to carry me. 
Give them broadswords and sweet liberty. 

Six pretty fair maids to bear my Pall, 
Give them white garlands and ribbons all.*) 
And when I'm dead they will speak the truth, 
He was a wild and a wicked youth. </pre>

<p>*) Dylan sings something else here</p>

<p>Additional fourth verse:</p>

<p>I robbed Lord Golding I do declare, <br>
And Lady Mansel, in Grosvenor Square; <br>
I shut the shutters and bad them good night. <br>
And home I went then&nbsp; to my heart's delight. </p>
