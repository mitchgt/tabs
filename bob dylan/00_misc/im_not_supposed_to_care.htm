<h1>I'm Not Supposed To Care</h1>

<p>Words and music Gordon Lightfoot<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan three times in May 1998<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>A beautiful tune! Much of the effect lies in the hypnotically ever-descending bass
line, with subtly changing chords above it. Also, the ornaments in the band turn a quite
simple country(ish) ballad into something quite complex.</p>

<pre>chords:

D	xx0232 or xx0775
D+  	xx0332 or xx0776
D6	xx0432 or xx0777
D7   	xx0532 or xx0778
Gm/bb	x10333
