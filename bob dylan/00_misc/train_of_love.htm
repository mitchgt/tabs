<p>[Hey, Johnny, I wanna say &quot;Hi!&quot; and sorry we can't be there, but that's just
the way it is. I wanna sing you one of your songs about trains. I used to sing this song
before I ever wrote a song, and I also want to thank you for standing up to me, way back
when.]</p>

<pre>C
Train of love's a-comin'

Big black wheels a-hummin'
F
People waitin' at the station

Happy hearts are drummin'
C
Trainman tell me maybe

Ain't you got my baby
G
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
                                       C
But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home.</pre>

<pre>
Now stop your whistle blowin'
'Cause I got ways of knowin'
Your bringin' other people's lovers
But my own keeps goin'
Train of love's deceivin'
When she's not gone she's leavin'
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home</pre>

<pre>Train of love's now hastin'
Sweethearts standin' waitin'
Here and there and everywhere
There's going to be embracin'
Trainman tell me maybe
Ain't you got my baby
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home</pre>

<pre>Train of love's a-leavin'
Leavin' my heart grievin'
Bur early or late, I sit and wait
Because I'm still believin'
We'll walk away together
Though I may wait forever
Every so often everybody's baby gets the urge to roam
But everybody's baby but mine's comin' home</pre>
