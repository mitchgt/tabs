Some have the speed and the right combinations
If you can't take the punches, it don't mean a thing</pre>

<h3>Dylan's version</h3>

<p>Some of the harmonic finesses lack - this is a more straightforward Em blues of some
kind. Some minor lyric changes, some of which may even be conscious.</p>

<p>Capo 3rd fret</p>
