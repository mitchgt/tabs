<pre>       G6                  D/f#
I been warped by the rain, driven by the snow
    Em            /d C
I'm drunk and dirty, don't ya know,
        G       C D  C  G
And I'm still           willin'.

Out on the road late at night,
I seen my pretty Alice in every head light
Alice, Dallas Alice</pre>

I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari

Tehachapi to Tonapah
            G             /a         /b        C
I've driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
C                                       D
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed

And if you give me weed, whites, and wine
                  D
And you show me a sign

I'll be willin',     to be movin'.</pre>

<pre>I've been kicked by the wind, robbed by the sleet
Had my head stoved in, but I'm still on my feet
And I'm still 
Willin
Smuggled some smokes and folks from Mexico
Baked by the sun, every time I go to Mexico
And I'm still</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonapah
Driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine
and you show me a sign
I'll be willin', to be movin'</pre>
