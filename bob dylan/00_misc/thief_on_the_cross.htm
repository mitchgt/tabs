<h1>Thief On The Cross</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan<br>
Dylan's last gospel song, performed once, in New Orleans, Nov 10, 1981<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>The riff that runs through the song is basically the same as in <a href="cover_down_break_through.htm">Cover Down Break Through</a>, and several other gospel
period songs. It can be played something like:</p>

<pre>  A                 D     C       
  :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .
|-0---------------|-2-----0---------|
|-2---------------|-3-----1---------|
|-2---------------|-2-----0---------|
|-2---------------|-0-----2---------|
|-0---------------|-------3---------|
|-----------------|-----------------|</pre>

<p>The C can be replaced by a D11 (xx0010 or x55555), and the order of the chords is
frequently reversed:</p>

<pre>  A                 C     D     C
  :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .  
|-0---------------|-0-----2-----0---|
|-2---------------|-1-----3-----1---|
|-2---------------|-0-----2-----0---|
|-2---------------|-2-----0-----2---|
|-0---------------|-3-----------3---|
|-----------------|-----------------|</pre>

<pre>E11 = 022232</pre>

<pre>     C                  D
Well everybody's been diverted,
     C                          D
Everybody lookin' the other way
c                           D
 Everybody's attention is divided
          C                 E11
Well they may not afford to wait, well - </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>There's a thief on the cross his chances are slim 
There's a thief on the cross I wanna talk to him </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Wanna ask him 'bout his mother 
Wanna ask him 'bout his world 
Wanna ask him 'bout to talk to himself 
If this time it didn't roll too well, well - </pre>

Head for the dawn and you can see it well 
And it's rising in his eyes, well - </pre>

<pre>Now there's winning, ruling and readin' 
Everybody goes [...]

There's a thief on the cross, 
There's a thief on the cross, 
There's a thief on the cross </pre>
