<h1>Cross The Green Mountain</h1>

<pre><font face="Garamond" size="3">Words and music Bob Dylan
Written for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Gods And Generals&quot; (preliminary release date February 21st, 2003)
Lyrics taken from communal efforts at the <a

<p><font face="Garamond" size="3">Two things are noteworthy from the guitaristic side. One
is the continuously sounding -----3 (highest string, third fret), throughout most of the
chords (see chord chart). The other is the bitonality of the second chord. Where I've
written a G/b chord, some of the instruments play a Bm chord, which clashes with the
-----3. There are some ways of approximating that on a single guitar, but none are
completely satisfying; see suggestions below. <br>
Apart from that, it's an interesting tune for three reasons: the difference between the
two types of verses, which are so similar that it's hard to keep them apart, but still
quite distinct; the irregular strophe structure, with the secondary verse form occurring
three times, with a different number of &quot;regular&quot; verses in between. The third
reason is more elusive, but despite its extreme simplicity, with basically the same chord
sequence (Am7-G/b-C-D, reversed in the bridge) for just about every line, it still works
wonderfully.</font></p>

 I cross the green mountain, I sit by the stream
Am7             G/b           C                  D
 Heaven blazing in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream
C          G/b     Am7        Dsus4 D Dsus2 D 
 Something came up out of the sea
Em                C           D            Em
Swept through the land of the rich and the free</pre>

I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then i ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet</pre>

Along the dim Atlantic line
the ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's coming forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avenging God</pre>

  <pre>The world is old, the world is gray 
Lessons of life, can&#146;t be learned in a day 
I watch and I wait, and I listen while I stand 
To the music that comes from a far-better land </pre>

<pre>Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know 
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low 
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend 
Killed outright he was, by his own men </pre>

<pre>C . . . G . C . G . . .</pre>

<pre>It&#146;s the last day&#146;s last hour, of the last happy year 
I feel that the unknown world is so near 
Pride will vanish and glory will rot 
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot </pre>

<pre>C . . . G . . . D . . .</pre>

<pre>The bells of leavening have rung 
There&#146;s blasphemy on every tongue 
Let &#145;em say that I walked in fair nature&#146;s light 
And that I was loyal to truth and to right </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond 
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn 
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained world 
They never dreamed of surrenderin&#146;, they fell where they stood </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star 
You&#146;re walkin&#146; in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen as the frost 
The ground&#146;s froze hard and the morning is lost </pre>

<pre>A letter to mother came today 
Gunshot wound to the breast is what it did say 
But he&#146;ll be better soon, he&#146;s in a hospital bed 
But he&#146;ll never be better - he&#146;s already dead </pre>

<pre>I&#146;m ten miles outside the city, and I&#146;m lifted away 
In an ancient light, that is not of day 
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew &#145;em all too well 
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tell<font
