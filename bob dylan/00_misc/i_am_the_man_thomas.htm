<blockquote>
  <pre>G
I am the Man Thomas

I am the Man

Look at these nail scars
D          G
Here in my hand</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>G
They drove me up the hill Thomas

I am the Man

They made me carry the cross Thomas
D        G
I am the Man</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I am the Man Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nail scars
Here in my hand</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>They crowned my head with thorns Thomas
I am the Man
They nailed me to the cross Thomas
I am the Man</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I am the Man Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nail scars
Here in my hand</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>They pierced me in the side
I am the Man
I died on the cross Thomas
I am the Man</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I am the Man Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nails scars
Here in my hand</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>They buried me in the tomb Thomas
I am the Man
In three days I rose Thomas
I am the Man</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I am the Man Thomas
I am the Man
Look at these nails scars
Here in my hand</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Dylan seems to have combined verse two and three into the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They pierced my side with thorns, Thomas<br>
  I am the Man<br>
  They made me carry the cross, Thomas<br>
  I am the Man</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's hard to work out exactly, though (Bob apparently thought so too). Suggestions for
words instead of thorns are: forks, pork and, more plausible, swords. At one show the
third line was, I believe, sung:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They drove me off a cliff, Thomas</p>
</blockquote>
