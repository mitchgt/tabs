<h1>Freedom For The Stallion</h1>

<p>Written by Allen Toussaint (the man who arranged the horn section on the Band's <em>Rock
of Ages</em> - great songwriter too!)<br>
Recorded by Bob Dylan June 1985<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 1st fret (sounding key Gb major)</p>

<p>Great tune, great singing (especially the
&quot;Lord-have-mer-cy-what-cha-gon-na-do&quot; lines). Nice little detail: the 0h1 on the
6th string at the beginning and here and there else.</p>
