<title>It's Hard To Be Blind</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Its Hard To Be Blind</h1>
<p>Trad. (this version attributed to Rev. Gary Davis)<br>
Played by Bob Dylan on the so-called Minnesota Party Tape II (May 1961) and 
Minnesota Hotel Tape (Dec 1961)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>
<hr>
<h3>Minnesota Party Tape II (May 1961)</h3>
<p>Capo 2nd fret (sounding key D major)</p>
<p>The guitar accompaniment has a fairly steady oompa-bass, as exemplified in 
the tab snipped below. <br>
The F is frequently played with the little flourish in the second measure below 
(indicated with an asterisk in the chord section).<br>
There are instrumental verses before, between, and after, which are more or less 
identical to the tabbed version.</p>
