<pre>D                    A
 Soft as a rain drop, fresh as the sea
                     D
Warm as the sunshine  shinin' on me
G     A      D     G     A      D 
 This was my love,  this was my love.

Light was her laughter, few were her tears
Gentle her beauty, tender her years
This was my love, this was my love.   D7</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>G             F#m   Em                D
 So young, so fair,  such soft golden hair
G             A      D
 Smile always on her face
G         F#m Em           D
No other love  can ever compare
   C         A        D
No other can take her place.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Others may cherish fortune or fame
I will forever cherish her name
This was my love, this was my love.</pre>

I will forever cherish her name
This was my love, this was my love</pre>
