<h1>Dink's Song</h1>

<p>(trad., John/Alan Lomax)<br>
Recorded in Bonnie Beecher's appartment, with Tony Glover at the recording wheels, on what
came to be known as the <em>Minnesota Hotel Tape</em>. Also played once during the second
Rolling Thunder Revue (Apr 25, 1976) in a duet with Joan Baez.<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<h3>&quot;Minnesota Hotel Tape&quot; version</h3>

<p>Dylan told Bonnie Beecher that he learned the song from a woman called Dink. So did
Alan Lomax, several years earlier... Read the whole story in <a
href="http://users.powernet.co.uk/barrett/The-Telegraph/extracts/dinks48.html">The
Telegraph</a>, or on Roger McGuinn's <a
href="http://metalab.unc.edu/jimmy/folkden/Dinks.html">Folk Den</a>, where you can also
hear his version of the song.</p>

<p>Capo 3rd fret (Original key Eb major)</p>

<p>Played by alternately lowering and raising all the fingers in a steady rhythmical
pattern over the chords C and F, later G and Am:</p>

<pre>  C     F           C     F
  :   .   .   .     :   .   .   .     
|-----------------|-----------------|
|-1-----1---0-1-0-|-1-----1---0-1-0-|
|-0-----2---0-2-0-|-0-----2---0-2-0-|
|-2-----3---0-3-0-|-2-----3---0-3-0-|  etc.
|-3-----3---0-3-0-|-3-----3---0-3-0-|
|-----------------|-----------------|
</pre>

<p>This pattern is usually repeated also at the end of each line, so that the first line
is: 

<ul>
  <li><pre>C  F     C    F C F C F 
If I had wings</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Chords (The 1st string should be kept silent, except in the Am chord): </p>

<pre>C      332010
F(maj) x33210
Am     002210
G      320003</pre>

<p>And don't forget the foot, tapping the rhythm a la John Lee Hooker.</p>

If I had wings
C    F      C    F      
like Noah's dove,
C   F       Am
I'd fly the river
             C     F
to the one I love.
C         Am       F       G
Fare thee well, my honey,
          C     F  
fare thee well.

I had a man
who was long and tall,
moved his body
like a cannonball.
Fare thee well, my honey,
fare thee well.

'member one evening
was drizzling rain,
and round my heart
I felt an aching pain.
Fare thee well, my honey,
fare thee well.

Once I wore
my apron low,
couldn't keep you
away from my door.
Fare thee well, my honey,
fare thee well.

Now my apron
is up to my chin,
you'll pass my door
but you'll never come in.
Fare thee well, my honey,
fare thee well.

Mighty river
runs muddy and wild,
can't care the bloody
for my unborn child.
Fare thee well, my honey,
fare thee well.

Number nine train
done no harm,
number nine train,
take my poor baby home.
Fare thee well, my honey,
fare thee well.

Fastest man
I ever saw,
was in Missouri
on the way to Arkansas.
Fare thee well, my honey,
fare thee well.

Glover: Is that the way the original goes?<br>
Bob: Huh?<br>
Glover: Is that the way the original goes?<br>
Bob: That's the way I heard it. I heard that from a lady named Dink. I don't know who
wrote it. Hah!</p>
