<pre>E                                 E7
I got a secret, and I ain't gonna tell
A                                  E
I'm going to Heaven in a split pea shell</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>A                      E         A
Oh Lordy me, didn't we shake sugaree
E            B       A       E
Everything I have is down in pawn.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I pawned my watch, and I pawned my chain
I even tried to sell myself, but I got down so ashamed</pre>

<pre>I've got a song to sing, and it's not very long
I'm gonna sing it right, if it takes me all night long.</pre>

<pre>I got a secret, and I ain't gonna tell
I'm going to Heaven in a split pea shell.</pre>

<h3>Different version (Cotten's own?) with additional verses not sung by Dylan</h3>

<p>I have a little song, won't take long <br>
Sing it right, once or twice <br>
Oh lord oh me, didn't I shake sugaree <br>
Everythiny I got is done in pawn (2x) </p>

<p>I pawned my watch, pawned my chain <br>
Pawned everything that was in my name </p>

<p>I pawned my buggy, house and cot <br>
Pawned everything that was on my lot </p>

<p>I pawned my chair, I pawned my bed <br>
Don't have nowhere to lay my head </p>

<p>I have a little secret I ain't gonna tell <br>
I'm goin' to heaven in a ground pea shell </p>

<p>I pawned my house, I've pawned my home <br>
Pawned everything that I own </p>

<p>I pawned my tobacco, I pawned my pipe <br>
Pawned everything that was in my sight </p>

<p>I know something, I ain't gonna tell <br>
I'm goin' to heaven and I ain't goin' to ... </p>

<p>I pawned my hat, I pawned my shoes <br>
Pawned everything that I could use </p>

<p>I chew my tobacco, spit my juice <br>
I would raise cain but it ain't no use </p>
