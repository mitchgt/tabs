<p>These definitely are classic &quot;Dylan Lyrics&quot; (shows his well hadn't run dry),
I knew it when i heard it, that it was Dylan. I wonder though, if the melody and the
chords are all his, I sure hope so. Great song. Nice key change too.<br>

In the night I hear you speak

Turn around, you're in my sleep
Bb(add9)
Feel your hands inside your soul
                                Dsus4/g
You're holding on and won't let go

Em                             C
I've tried running but there's no escape

Can't bend them, and (I know) I just can't break these...</pre>

Steel bars, wrapped all around me
G               D                  Em      C
 I've been your prisoner since the day you found me

 I'm bound forever, till the end of time

Steel bars wrapped around this heart of mine</pre>

<pre>
Trying hard to recognize
See the face behind the eyes
Feel your haunting ways like chains
'Round my heart they still remain

I'm still running, but there's nowhere to hide
My love for you has got me locked up inside these...</pre>

And with every step I take
                          
Every desperate move I make

It's clear to me
Bm
What can all my living mean
     C
When time itself is so obscene
     Am
When time itself don't mean a thing
    D
I'm still loving you</pre>

<p>How did this unlikely collaboration come about? The following is from a posting to
rec.music.dylan by Olof Bjorner on 16 May 1991: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Michael Bolton: &quot;We're planning on writing some more songs together. He's kind of
  hungry to get back out there and wants to work with a few contemporary hit song writers.
  Someone who works with Dylan called me up and said 'Bob Dylan would like to write with
  you'. I was awed. I told him, 'I don't even know how I could write a lyric when working
  with you ... I'm too intimidated'. But then we started messing around with some chords and
  wrote Steel Bars, a song about obsession. It took us two sessions to write, and when I
  left, I was told, 'Bob likes you and he wants you to come back'.&quot; </p>
