<blockquote>
  <pre>C     
This world can't stand that long
F              C
Be ready don't wait too late
G
You should know it can't stand long
                      C
For it is too full of hate</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>For a long time this world has stood
Gets more wicked every day
the maker who created it
Surely won't let it stand this way</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>This world can't stand too long
Be ready don't wait too late
You should know it can't stand long
For it is too full of hate</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>This world's been destroyed before
Cause it is too full of sin
For that very reason
It will be destroyed again</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>This world it can't stand long
Be ready don't wait too late
You should know it can't stand long
For it is too full of hate</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>If we only give our hearts to God
Let him lead us by the hand
Nothing in this world to fear
He'll lead you across the golden sand</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>This world it can't stand long
Be ready don't wait too late
You should know it can't stand long
For it is too full of hate</pre>
