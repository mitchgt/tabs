<h1>Diamond Joe</h1>
<p>Trad. <br>
Recorded and filmed by Bob Dylan w/band for <i>Masked and Anonymous </i>(2003)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>
<hr>
<p><i>Diamond Jo </i>was the name of a steamboat that ran on the upper 
Mississippi in the period 1864-83, owned by &quot;Diamond Jo&quot; Reynolds. (He also 
built his own railroad from Malvern to Hot Springs (Arkansas, I believe), after 
a painful carriage trip to cure his rheumatism in the healing waters of Hot 
Springs). The refrain line &quot;Diamond Jo come and get me&quot; could be a reference to 
the boat. <br>
Early versions of the song recorded by the Georgia Crackers (1927) and Charlie 
Butler (1937), then a prisoner at the Parchman prison.<br>
The song is not related to <i><a href="../35_gaibty/diamond_joe.htm">Diamond Joe</a></i> 
on <i>Good As I Been To You</i>, neither musically nor thematically.</p>
