<pre>A
I'm trippin over dumb drunks at a party 
F                      G                 A
My girlfriend just ran off with the DJ 
A
I'd give her everything I had, but she refused it 
F                        G                         A
It don't matter now, she don't know how to use it 
C
My confidence is dwindling 
D
Look at the shape I'm in 
C
Where's my pearls, where's the swine? 
D                                           (n.c.)
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standing in line. 
                    A
I'll have the usual 

Yeah, I'll have the usual </pre>

<p>Fifty silhouettes now tumblin' on the dance floor <br>
Pink elephants fallin' through a trap door <br>
Sixty cigarettes a day because I'm nervous <br>
When will that bitch begin to serve us? <br>
I used to be a good boy, livin' the good life <br>
Fifty thousand kisses later she was a housewife <br>
She was good, I was unkind <br>
I'm not thirsty, but I'm standin' in line <br>
I'll have the usual, yeah<br>
I'll have the usual </p>

<p>Big Jim says that the second comin's comin' <br>
I think he must be seein' double or something <br>
You can hang around here, waiting for the offerings<br>
I can't win, but I've seen enough, man <br>
A fifth of whisky keep the doctor away <br>
A little more and it's judgment day <br>
I had a future, but she just passed out <br>
I'm gonna drink until I see what am I talkin' about <br>
I'll have the usual, yeah<br>
I'll have the usual <br>
I'll have the usual <br>
Yeah, the usual</p>
