<p>These three verses (plus a fourth that I couldn't make out) were played over and over
again, in no particular order.</p>

<pre>          E          B
I got the key to the highway, 
E                A
 I feel bound to go. 
          E   
I'm gonna leave here running; 
B                   E
Walking is most too slow. </pre>

<pre>I'm going down to the border 
Woman, where I'm better known. 
Well you ain't done nothing but 
drive a good man from his home. </pre>

<pre>Kiss me one, one time more mama 
One time before I go, 
When I leave this time I 
won't be back no more.</pre>
