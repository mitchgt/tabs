I've got a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.
                                                B
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.
                                                                    E
Ain't that I'm wiser, I've just spent more time with my back to the wall.
         F#                                                    B
And I've picked up a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.</pre>

<pre>I've been down more roads than you, babe, and that's all.
I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl.
You're headin&#146; somewhere, I've been that somewhere, found it&#146;s nowhere at all.
And I've picked up a couple more years on you babe, and that's all.</pre>

<p>And here's the finish, the last verse, which was not played in the film:</p>

<pre>Now sayin' goodbye, girl don't ever come easy at all.
But you've got to fly 'cause you're hearin' those young eagles call.
And someday when you're older, you'll smile at a man strong and tall.
And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you, babe, and that's all.</pre>
