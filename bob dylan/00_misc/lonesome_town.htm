<h1>Lonesome Town</h1>

<p>Written by Baker Knight, recorded by Ricky Nelson<br>
Played live by Bob Dylan during the 1986 tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>The &quot;(Dm)&quot; in the third line could be played both as an Fm or as a Dm, or as
a combination of the two: both xx3130 and xx0111 ar possible alternatives.&nbsp; </p>

<pre>G11 	3x3211</pre>

<p>The lyrics differ somewhat from Ricky Nelson's, on minor points (such as the change of
&quot;In the town of broken dreams&quot; to &quot;There's a town . . .&quot;).</p>

<pre>C              E
There's a place where lovers go
F            G(11)     C     (/d-e)
To cry their troubles away,
F        (Dm)    C        Am
And they call it lonesome town,
Dm        G(11)         C     G(11)
Where the broken hearts stay. </pre>

<pre>You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years,
And the only price you pay
Is a heart full of tears. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>F             Em
Goin' down to lonesome town
Dm                      C   (/d-e)
Where the broken hearts stay,
F             Em
Maybe down in lonesome town
     D7              G(11)
I'll cry my troubles away. </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>There's a place of broken dreams
Every streets is filled with regret.
Maybe down in lonesome town
I can learn to forget. </pre>
