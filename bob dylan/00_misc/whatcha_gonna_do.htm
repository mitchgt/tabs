<h1>Whatcha Gonna Do?</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded Nov 14 and Dec 6 1962 during the <a href="../02_freewheelin/index.htm"><em>Freewheelin'</em></a>
sessions<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>Open D tuning, capo 5th fret (sounding key G major)</p>

<p>Chords:</p>

<pre>D    000000
G/d  020100
D(3) 054300 or 004300 or 004350
D/f# 404300
A7   x02100 or x02140
A    777777</pre>

<p>The playing on this one is really very simple, but he's playing around with the basic
elements (both the chord shapes, the rhythms and the chord sequences) in a way that makes
it look complicated on paper. <br>
Concerning the D(3) chord (i.e. D in the third position, i.e. beginning in the 3rd fret),
the first fingering (054300) is to be preferred when it replaces the D-G/d-D figure, as in
the second verse, and the second or third (004350) when it is played in the succession
D-A7-D. The fingering D(3)=004300 goes with A7=002100,&nbsp; and D(3)=004350 with
A7=002140.<br>
I've written out the chords to the first three verses, which I think cover most of the
variants in the handling of this song.</p>

<p>The rhythm in the D-G/d-D parts varies between straight beats and syncopated
hammer-ons:</p>

<pre>  D       G/d            D     G/d
  :   .   .   .          :   .   .   .   
|-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|
|-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|
|-0---0---1---1---| or |-0---0h1---1-1---|
|-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|
|-0---0---2---2---|    |-0---0h2---2-2---|
|-0---0---0---0---|    |-0---0-----0-0---|</pre>
