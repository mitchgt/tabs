Wanted man in California,
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City,
Wanted man in Ohio

Wanted man in Mississippi,
Wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight 
you might see this wanted man

I might be in Colorado,
Or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man 
who may not know who I might be

If you ever see me coming 
and if you know who I am
Don't you breathe it to nobody 
'cause you know I'm on the lamb

Wanted man by Lucy Watson,
Wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson,
Wanted man in this next town

Well, I've had all that I wanted 
of a lot of things I've had
And a lot more than I needed 
of some things that turned out bad

I got sidetracked in El Paso,
Stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way in Pleura 
with Juanita on my back

Then I went to sleep in Shreveport,
Woke up in Abilene
Wonderin' why I'm wanted 
at some town half way between

Wanted man in Albuquerque,
Wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee,
Wanted man in Baton Rouge

There's somebody set to grab me&nbsp;
Anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight&nbsp;
You might get a glimpse of me

Wanted man in California,
Wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City,
Wanted man in Ohio

Wanted man in Mississippi,
Wanted man in ol' Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight 
you might see this wanted man</pre>
