<tt>'Twas on a bright March morning I bid New Orleans adieu.</tt> 
<tt>&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *)</tt> 
<tt>I took the train from Jackson, my fortune to renew,</tt> 
<tt>&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *)</tt> 
<tt>I cursed all foreign money, no credit could I gain,</tt> 
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Em&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C</tt> 
<tt>Which sent my heart a-longing for the lakes of Pontchartrain.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>I hopped on board of a railway car, beneath the morning sun,</tt> 
<tt>I rode the roads till the evening, then I laid me down again,</tt> 
<tt>All strangers there, no friends to me, till a dark girl towards me came,</tt> 
<tt>And I fell in love with a Creole girl, on the lakes of Pontchartrain.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>I said, &quot;My pretty Creole girl, my money here's no good,</tt> 
<tt>if it weren't for the alligators, I'd sleep out in the wood&quot;.</tt> 
<tt>&quot;You're welcome here kind stranger, our home is very plain.</tt> 
<tt>But we never turn a stranger out, on the lakes of Pontchartrain.&quot;</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>She took me into her mammy's house, and treated me quite well,</tt> 
<tt>The hair upon her shoulders in jet black ringlets fell.</tt> 
<tt>To try and paint her beauty, I'm sure 'twould be in vain,</tt> 
<tt>So handsome was my Creole girl, on the lakes of Pontchartrain.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>I asked her if she would marry me, she said that never can be,</tt> 
<tt>For she had got a lover, and he was far at sea.</tt> 
<tt>She swore that she'd be true to him and true she would remain.</tt> 
<tt>Till he returned to his Creole girl, on the banks of Pontchartrain.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>So fare thee well my pretty young girl, I never will see you no more,</tt> 
<tt>But I'll ne'er forget your kindness in the cottage by the shore.</tt> 
<tt>And at each social gathering a flowing glass I'll drain,</tt> 
<tt>And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl, on the banks of Pontchartrain.</tt> &nbsp; </pre>
