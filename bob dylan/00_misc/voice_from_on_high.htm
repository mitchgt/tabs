<h1>Voice From On High/I Hear A Voice Calling</h1>

<p>Words and music Bill Monroe and Bessie Lee Mauldin<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan as an opener in Hamburg, NY, Aug 15, 2002<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (thanks to zepat for supplies)</p>

<h3>Dylan's version</h3>

<p>Dylan is closer to Bill Monroe's version than to the Stanley Brothers', both in the
lyrics and in the turn to A7 (D7 in Monroe's version) in the verse. <br>
If anyone can make out what he is (or should be) singing in the first verse, I'd be happy
to <a href="mailto:eyolf@dylanchords.com">receive a note</a>. The only radical difference
from the older versions is the end of the lines in the chorus: <em>they</em> hold them and
weave a little something between the voices - Dylan &amp; Co cut it short.</p>

I hear a voice calling, it must be our Lord

He's calling from heaven on high
               G             C            G    C/g  G   
I hear a voice calling, I've gained the reward

[The Saviour has] paid a great price for me
                           A7                  D       D7
He died on the hill so [my friends?] should go free
                      G                C      G
Well, I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
       G                         D             G
And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day</pre>

He's calling from heaven on high

In the land where we never shall die.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>He died on the cross, that old rugged cross
So we should be saved in our sins and our loss
So I'll follow his footsteps up the narrow way
And be ready to meet him when he calls on that day</pre>

<p>*) More theologically correct would, I suppose, be: &quot;And <em>he'll </em>pay our
debts . . .&quot;, but they clearly sing &quot;we'll . . .&quot; </p>
