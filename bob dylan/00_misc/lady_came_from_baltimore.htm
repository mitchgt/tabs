<h1>The Lady Came From Baltimore</h1>

<p>Written by Tim Hardin (1967)<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan in 1992 (once) and 1994 (three times)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (based on the version from Apr 13 1994)</p>

<hr>

<p>Capo 1st fret (sounding key C# major), or a fast tape.</p>

<p>The G at the beginning of the chorus is tinted with a c, i.e. it could basically be
played as a Gsus4 (e.g. 320013), although it may also be the outcome of two different
chords (C and G) being played on two different guitars.</p>

<pre>C              G
Lady came from Baltimore, 
F                C
All she wore was lace. 
F                    C
 She never knew that I was poor, 
G(sus4       G)
never saw my face. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Am             G
I was there to take her money, 
F                   C
Steal her rings and run. 
F              C
Then I fell in love 
         G                   C
with the lady, got away with none. </pre>
  <pre>[1 verse/refrain interlude]</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>The lady's name was Susan Moore, 
Her daddy read the law. 
She never knew that I was poor, 
And lived outside the law. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Her daddy said, I was a thief
Never married her for love. 
It was Susan's true belief 
I married her for love. </pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I was there to take her money, 
Steal her rings and run. 
Then I fell in love 
with the lady,  got away with none. </pre>
  <pre>[1 verse/refrain interlude]</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Outside her house there was a wall
To keep the robbers out. 
She'd never stop to think at all
If that's what I'm about. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I was there to take her money, 
Steal her rings and run. 
Then I fell in love 
with the lady, got away with none. </pre>
