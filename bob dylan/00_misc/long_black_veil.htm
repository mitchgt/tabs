Ten years ago on a     cold dark night
G                           F            C
Someone was shot 'neath the town hall light 
    C           Csus4         C           Csus4 C 
The people who saw, well they all agreed
         G                        F          C   Csus4 C
That the slayer that ran looked a lot like me </pre>

<pre>
The judge said &quot;Son, what is your alibi? 
If you were somewhere else you won't have to die&quot; 
I spoke not a word though it meant my life 
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>    F           C          F          C
She walks these hills in a long black veil 
F         C              F           C
Visits my grave when the night winds wail 
C                F      C
Nobody knows and nobody sees 
F      G         C     Csus4 C
Nobody knows but me </pre>
  <pre>C . . . | C . . . |
G . . . | F . C . |</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>The scaffold was high, eternity near 
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear 
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans 
In a long black veil she shivers over my bones </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>She walks these hills in a long black veil 
Visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me </pre>
