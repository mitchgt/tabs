<font FACE="Garamond">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Written by Thomas A. Dorsey<br>
Performed once by Bob Dylan (Les Arènes, Frejus, France </font>13 June 1989)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem<font FACE="Garamond"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font>Dylan's performance is a tremendous one, but one where -- as
often is the case with his one-offs -- the words aren't always clear. I've noted some
deviations from the &quot;standard&quot; version, but not all of them. The end of the
chorus is sung differently, but I can't hear what he's singing there. Thus, the version
below is a hybrid: neither exactly what Dylan sings, nor what he should have sung.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either the tape is a little fast, or he has a capo on the 1st fret.</p>
