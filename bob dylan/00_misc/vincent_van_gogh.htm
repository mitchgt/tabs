<br><tt>I'd like to tell you a story&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D</tt>
<br><tt>of a man that you might know.</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D</tt>
<br><tt>His parents all called him Vincent,</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D</tt>
<br><tt>his last name was Van Gogh.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>He started drinking and painting</tt>
<br><tt>and living a life of sin.</tt>
<br><tt>He fell in with evil companions,</tt>
<br><tt>a man named Paul Gaugin.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>They went to the city of Auvers,</tt>
<br><tt>pursuing their carnal delights.</tt>
<br><tt>They painted all during the afternoon</tt>
<br><tt>and they played music all night.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>Now the people of that small city</tt>
<br><tt>thought he was a little bit queer,</tt>
<br><tt>to prove his love for mankind,</tt>
<br><tt>he chopped off his outside ear.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>So they put him in an institution</tt>
<br><tt>but they could not keep him there.</tt>
<br><tt>He picked up his paints and his easel</tt>
<br><tt>and he went out to take some air.</tt><tt></tt>

<p><tt>He picked up his paints and his easel</tt>
<br><tt>and he went out to paint some crows.</tt>
<br><tt>They found him face down in a cornfield,</tt>
<br><tt>shot right between two rows.</tt><tt></tt>
