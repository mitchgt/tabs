<h1>Rock Me Mama</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded during the sessions for <a href="../12_billy/index.htm"><em>Pat Garret &amp;
Billy The Kid</em></a> (feb 1973)<br>
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The words are absolutely not clear. Brackets mean that I can't hear what he's singing,
and whatever is within them is only an approximation to the sounds I hear, just to have <em>something
</em>there to sing. Words outside the brackets are slightly more certain, but only
slightly.</p>

<p>At least the chords are clear.</p>
