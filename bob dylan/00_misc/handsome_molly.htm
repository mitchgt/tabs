<pre>      D                    G . D . . .
Oh, I wish I was in London, 
                      A
Or some other seaport town; 
    D           
I'd put my foot on a steamboat, 
    G               D    . . .
I'd sail the ocean 'round. </pre>

<pre>While sailing 'round the ocean, 
While sailing 'round the sea, 
I'd think of handsome Molly 
Wherever she might be. </pre>

<pre>Don't you remember, Molly, 
You gave me your right hand? 
You said if ever you'd marry 
I'd be your man </pre>

<pre>But  you broke your promise, 
Go with whom you please, 
My poor heart is aching 
You are at your ease. </pre>

<pre>I went to church last Sunday, 
Molly came ridin' by; 
I could tell her mind was changing 
By the rovin' of her eye. </pre>

<pre>I'll go down to the river, 
When everyone's asleep. 
I'll think of handsome Molly 
An' I'll begin ta weep. </pre>

<pre>So I wish I was in London, 
Or some other seaport town; 
I'd put my foot on a steamboat, 
I'd sail the ocean 'round. </pre>
