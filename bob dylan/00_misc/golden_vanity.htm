Lyrics transcribed by Michael Pucci<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>First of all: note the similarity with <em>Under The Red Sky</em>, both in the way the
chords go, and the first phrase.</p>

<p>Then there's the little &quot;thing&quot; that occurs here and there, particularly in
the verse where marked with a *) and at the beginning of the verses:</p>

<pre>  C
  :   .     :
|---------|-------

<p>&quot;This one's got all that stuff in it. You'll see. It's got all that and
more.&quot;</p>

<pre>C</pre>

<pre>                   C     Csus4 C
There was a little ship 
       Csus4            C    Csus4 C
and it sailed along the sea 
        C                        F          C
and the name of the ship was the golden vanity 
        *)            C  Csus4 C     Csus4      C   Csus4 C
and she sailed in the low        and lonesome ocean 
        C             G        C
and she sailed in the lonesome sea. </pre>

<pre>There was another ship sailing along the sea 
and the name of that ship was the Turkish Revelry* 
and sailing down that low and lonesome ocean 
saling in the lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>There was a cabin boy he said what would you give to me 
if I swim alongside of the Turkish Revelry* 
and sink her in the low and lonesome ocean 
if I sink her in the lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>Well, I will give you gold and I will give you land 
and my own lovely daughter she'll be at your command 
if you sink her in the low and lonesome ocean 
if you sink her in the lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>He bowed his breath, overboard jumped he 
and he swum 'til he came to the Turkish Revelry 
sailing in the low and lonesome ocean 
sailing in the lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>He had a little tool and all good men could bore 
and drilled nine holes in that ship's floor 
then he sunk it the low and lonesome ocean 
he sunk it in the lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>And he bowed his breath, back swam he 
and he swum 'til he came to the Golden Vanity 
sailing in the low and lonesome ocean 
sailing in the lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>O' captain will you be as good as your word 
and throw down a line and take me up on board 
I'm sinking in that low and lonesome ocean 
sinking in that lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>No, I'll not be as good as my word 
I'll not throw down a line or to take you back on board 
You'll gonna sink in that low and lonesome ocean 
Sink in that lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>If it wasn't for the love that I have onto your men 
I would do onto you like I done onto them 
I'd sink you in the low and lonesome ocean 
Sink you in that lonesome sea </pre>

<pre>So he bowed his breath and down went he 
He swam til he came to pass down with [...]** 
and he sunk in that low and lonesome ocean 
He sunk in that lonesome sea </pre>

<p>* Bob, if you listen to the whole show, is obviously drunk and he stumbles on the name
of the other ship.&nbsp; Traditionally the ship is the Turkish Revelry. <br>
** I have no idea what he is saying here. <img alt="1" height="1"

&quot;...to the bottom of the sea&quot; here, which fits nicely.</p>
