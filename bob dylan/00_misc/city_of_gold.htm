<pre>           C   G   C
There is a city of gold
              C                           F
far from this rat-race with the bars that hold
                C                     F
far from the confusion, eat's at your soul
           C   G   F     C
There is a city of gold. 

There is a country of light 
Raised up in glory, angels wearing white 
Never know sickness, never know night 
There is a country of light. 

There is a city of love 
Way from this world, stuff dreams are made of 
Fear of no darkness, stars high above 
There is a city of love. 

There is a city of hope 
There ain't no doctor, don't need no dope 
I'm ready and willing, throw down a rope 
There is a city of hope. 

There is a city of gold
Far from this rat race And these bars that hold 
Rest for your spirit, peace for your soul 
There is a city of gold</pre>

<pre>           C   G   F   C/e Dm C
There is a city of gold</pre>

<pre>      D7   G
There is a city of love 
Surrounded by stars and the power above
Far from this world and the stuff dreams are made of
There is a city, city of love. </pre>
<pre>There is a city of grace
You drink holy water in a sanctified's place 
one's afraid to show their face
There is a city, a city of grace</pre>
<pre>[interlude]</pre>
<pre>There is a city of peace
Where all [foul form of] destruction will cease
When the mighty have fallen and there's no police
There is a city, a city of peace</pre>
<pre>There is a city of hope 
Across the ravines by the green sunlit slope
All I need is an axe and a rope 
To get to the city of hope. </pre>
<pre>[interlude]</pre>
<pre>I'm headed for the city of gold
Before it's too late, before it gets too cold
Before I'm too tired, before I'm too old
I'm headed for the city of gold</pre>
<pre>There is a city of gold (ad lib)</pre>
