<h1>Wait For The Light To Shine</h1>

<p>Written by Fred Rose and popularized by Hank Williams<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan during the fall 2001 tour<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>Dylan's lyrics differ slightly from Williams' (i.e. Rose's), which is the basis for the
version below. <br>
I have included some additional verses not sung by Dylan at the end of the file.</p>

<p>The chords at the end are the outcome of a clash between the C chords of the guitars
and the D in the bass.</p>

<p><b>Additional verses, not sung by Bob Dylan</b> </p>

<pre>If your life is empty and you're on your last go-round
Wait for the light to shine
If you hear the chime-knells on the highway you have found
Wait for the light to shine 

   Wait for the light to shine
   Wait for the light to shine
   When your friends forsake you and you haven't got a dime
   Wait for the light to shine 	

Don't let trouble fool you and your sins will all be gone
Wait for the light to shine
Don't forget it's darkest just before the break of dawn
Wait for the light to shine

   Wait for the light to shine
   Wait for the light to shine
   Keep these words before you as you walk that narrow line
   Wait for the light to shine
