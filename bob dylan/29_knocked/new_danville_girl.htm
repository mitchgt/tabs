<h1 ALIGN="left">New Danville Girl/Brownsville Girl</font></h1>

<p ALIGN="left"><font FACE="Garamond">Written by Bob Dylan/Sam Shepard<br>
Recorded as &quot;New Danville Girl&quot; Dec 1984 during the <em><a
href="../27_empire/index.htm">Empire Burlesque</a> </em>sessions, and released with
rewritten lyrics on <em><a href="index.htm">Knocked out Loaded</a> </em>(1986), as the
only real excuse for that album. Since it's one of Dylan's greatest epic ballads, it's a
good excuse.<br>
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem</font></p>

<p ALIGN="left">I've indicated the chords with simple chord names, but they are played
with the first string open most of the time, which gives the following chord names:</p>
<div align="left">

<pre>D  = Dadd9   xx0230
Bm = Bmadd11 224430
E  = Esus4   022200 (or E11 022232)</pre>
</div>

<p ALIGN="left">The A is usually embellished by Asus4 (x02230) or Asus2 (x02200),
occasionally also A6 (x02222)</p>

Bm                                  E                 A
All I remember about it was that it starred Gregory Peck.
       A                                                       D
He was shot down in the back by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself.
    Bm                                            E                        A 
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck. </pre>
