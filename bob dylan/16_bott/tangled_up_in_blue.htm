<tt>Abandoned it out West</tt>

<pre><tt>He had a job in the old north woods</tt> 
<tt>Working as a cook for a spell</tt> 
<tt>But he never did like it all that much</tt> 
<tt>And one day the ax just fell.</tt> 
<tt>Well, he drifted down to L.A.</tt>
<tt>Where he reckoned to try his luck</tt>
<tt>Workin' for a while on an airplane plant,</tt>
<tt>Loading cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone</tt> 
<tt>The past was close behind,</tt> 
<tt>He seen a lot of women</tt> 
<tt>But she never escaped his mind, and he just grew</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>She was workin' in a topless place</tt> 
<tt>And I stopped in for a beer,</tt> 
<tt>I just kept looking' at the side of her face</tt> 
<tt>In the spotlight so clear.</tt> 
<tt>And later on, as the crowd thinned out</tt> 
<tt>I's about to do the same,</tt> 
<tt>She was standing there in back of my chair</tt> 
<tt>Said to me, &quot;What's your name?&quot;</tt> 
<tt>I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,</tt> 
<tt>She studied the lines on my face.</tt> 
<tt>I must admit I felt a little uneasy</tt> 
<tt>When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe</tt> 
<tt>&quot;I thought you'd never say hello,&quot; she said</tt> 
<tt>&quot;You look like the silent type.&quot;</tt> 
<tt>Then she opened up a book of poems</tt> 
<tt>And handed it to me</tt> 
<tt>Written by an Italian poet</tt> 
<tt>From the thirteenth century.</tt> 
<tt>And every one of them words rang true</tt> 
<tt>And glowed like burnin' coal</tt> 
<tt>Pourin' off of every page</tt> 
<tt>Like it was written in my soul from me to you,</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt> </pre>

<pre>He was always in a hurry,
too busy or too stoned,
And everything that she ever planned,
just a-had to be postponed.
She thought they were successful,
She thought they were blessed,                          He thought . . .
with objects and material things,
but I never was impressed.
And when it all came crashing down,<tt> 
I became withdrawn,</tt> 
<tt>The only thing I knew how to do</tt> 
<tt>Was to keep on keepin' on</tt> 
<tt>Like a bird that flew</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>So now I'm goin' back again,</tt> 
<tt>I got to get to her somehow.</tt> 
<tt>All the people we used to know</tt> 
<tt>They're an illusion to me now.</tt> 
<tt>Some are mathematicians</tt> 
<tt>Some are doctors' wives.</tt> 
<tt>Don't know how it all got started,</tt> 
<tt>I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.</tt> 
<tt>But me, I'm still on the road</tt> 
<tt>Headin' for another joint</tt> 
<tt>We always did feel the same,</tt> 
<tt>We just saw it from a different point of view,</tt>

<tt>She was standing there right behind my chair</tt> 
<tt>Toughing me said: &quot;You know it ain't no accident that you came.&quot;</tt>
<tt>I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,</tt> 
<tt>She studied the lines on my face.</tt> 
<tt>I must admit I felt a little uneasy</tt> 
<tt>When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>She lit a burner on the stove, wearin' a dress made up of stars and stripes</tt>
<tt>&quot;I thought you'd never say hello,&quot; she said</tt> 
<tt>&quot;You know you look like you could be the silent type.&quot;</tt> 
<tt>Then she opened up the Bible</tt>
<tt>And she started quotin' it to me</tt> 
Jeremiah chapter seventeen
From verses 21 and 33.
<tt>And every one of them words rang true</tt> 
<tt>And glowed like burnin' coal</tt> 
<tt>Pourin' off of every page</tt> 
<tt>Like it was written in my soul from me to you,</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt></pre>

<pre><tt>I lived with them on Montague Street</tt> 
<tt>In a basement down the stairs,</tt> 
<tt>There was music in the cafes at night</tt>,
<tt>There was revolution in the air.</tt> 
<tt>Then he started into dealing with slaves</tt> 
<tt>And something inside of her froze.</tt> 
<tt>She had to sell everything she owned</tt> 
<tt>Even her jewellery and her clothes.</tt> 
<tt>And when it all came crashing on, I became withdrawn,</tt> 
<tt>The only thing I knew how to do</tt> 
<tt>Was to keep on keepin' on</tt> 
<tt>Like a bird that flew</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt> </pre>

<pre><tt>So now I'm goin' back again,</tt> 
<tt>I got to get to her and be brave.</tt> 
<tt>All the people we used to know</tt>,
At least the ones that ain't in the grave,
<tt>Some are bricklayers, some are bankrobbers</tt>
<tt>Some are burglars and some are truck-drivers' wives.</tt>
<tt>I Don't know how it all got started,</tt> 
<tt>I have no idea what they're doin' with their lives.</tt> 
<tt>But me, I'm still on the road</tt> 
<tt>Headin' for another joint</tt> 
<tt>We always did feel the same,</tt> 
<tt>We just saw it from a different point of view,</tt> 
<tt>Tangled up in blue.</tt> </pre>

<pre>She was married when they first met,
to a man four times her age.
He left her penniless, in the state of regret,
it was time to bust out of the cage.
They drove that car as far as they could,
abandoned it out west.
splitting up on a dark, sad night,
both agreeing that it was best.
And she turned around to look at him 
as he was walking away.
She said I wish I could tell you all the things
that I never learned how to say.
He said thats alright babe I love you too,
but we were tangled up in blue.</pre>

<pre>He had a steady job and a pretty face,
and everything seemed to fit.
One day he could just feel the waste,
he put it all down and split.
And he headed down to New Orleans,
where they treated him like a boy.
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge,
he nearly drowned in Delacroix.
And all the time he was alone,
the past was close behind.
he had one too many lovers then,
and none of them were too refined,
all except for you,
but you were tangled up in blue.</pre>

<pre>She was working in the blinding light,
and I stopped in for a drink.
I just kept looking at her face so white,
I didn't know what to think.
Later on as the crowd thinned out,
I was getting ready to leave.
She was standing there, beside my chair,
saying &quot;What's that you got up your sleeve?&quot;
I said &quot;nothing baby, and thats for sure&quot;
She leaned down into my face.
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her
as she bent down to tie the laces
of my shoe, 
Tangled up in blue.</pre>

<pre>I lived with them on Montague street
in a basement down the stairs.
There was snow all winter and no heat,
revolution was in the air.
Then one day all his slaves ran free,
and something inside of him died.
The only thing I could do was be me,
and get on that train and ride.
And when it all came crashing down,
I was already south.
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round,
I had the worst taste in my mouth,
that I ever knew,
Tangled up in blue.</pre>

<pre>Now I'm going back again, 
maybe tomorrow, maybe next year.
I've got to find someone among the women and men
whose destiny is unclear.
Some are ministers of illusion,
some are masters of the trade.
All under strong delusion,
all of their beds unmade.
Me I'm heading toward the sun,
trying to stay out of the joints.
We always did love the very same one.
We just saw her from a different point
of view,
Tangled up in blue.</pre>

<h3>Current acoustic version (1997-)</h3>

<p>Since Larry Campbell joined the band in 1997, Tangled has been played as an acoustic
song, with Larry playing the intro below. Larry's guitar is played with a capo on the 2nd
fret, Bob's guitar is uncapoed. The chords are more or less those of the <em>Blood on the
Tracks </em>version above.</p>
