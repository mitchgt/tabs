<h4>Bootleg series 1-3 version</h4>
<font SIZE="-1">

<p></font><small>The only difference between the two New York versions, apart from the
organ on the refrains in the above version, is some slight changes in some of the lyrics.
It's really negligible, but for the sake of (trainspotterish) completeness, here it is
(the first verse is identical): </small></p>

<pre><tt>
I ran into the fortune teller, she said beware 'cause some lightning might strike.</tt> 
<tt>I haven't known about peace and quiet now for so long I don't even remember what it's like.</tt> 
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,
He didn't know it, he never thought it could be done, but at the final shot he won the war
After losin' every battle.

I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things really are
Visions of your smokin'  shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars.
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.
One day you'll be in the grave, flies buzzin' around your eyes,
Blood on your saddle.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Blowing through the curtains in your room.
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still can even breathe.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom.

I noticed at the ceremony, that your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't recall your face anymore, your mouth has changed and your eyes don't look into mine.
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building burned.
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime 
turned Slowly into autumn.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the clothes you wear
Every time I come into your door, you leave me standing in the middle of the air..
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your ragin' glory.

I been double-crossed now for the very last time and I think I finally see,
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,
And it makes me feel so sorry.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
We're idiots, babe.
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.</pre>
