<h1>Simple Twist of Fate</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Blood on the Tracks</a> </em>(1975) and live on <em><a
href="../21_budokan/index.htm">At Budokan</a> </em>(1978) and <em><a
href="../42_bs5/index.htm">Live 1975</a> </em>(2002)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The lyrics were re-written already in time for the Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975, and
the new lyrics have stuck - he never sings it like on the record anymore. There are
numerous variations along the way.<br>
The lyric changes in 1984 were more substantial, and have been awarded a separate section
below. They are also on the whole less clear, and they keep changing from day to day.</p>

They sat together in the park
Emaj7
As the evening sky grew dark,
E7                                    
She looked at him and he felt a spark 
A                     A'
tingle to his bones.
Am
'Twas then he felt alone 
    E           B(ii)     A        A'
and wished that he'd gone straight
    E                 B11             B11' E
And watched out for a simple twist of      fate.</pre>

<pre>
They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel 
with a neon burnin' bright.
He felt the heat of the night 
hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade.
As the light bust through a beat-up shade 
where he was wakin' up,
She dropped a coin into the cup 
of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care, 
pushed the window open wide,
Felt an emptiness inside 
to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks 
where the sailers all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again, 
how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate.

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within.
I still believe she was my twin, 
but I lost the ring.
She was born in spring, 
but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate.</pre>

<h3>28 June 1984 Barcelona</h3>

<p>As transcribed by Arthur Jarosinski, with suggestions from Eben Hensby incorporated.</p>

<p>They sat together in the park<br>
As the evening sky got dark<br>
She looked at him and felt a spark<br>
Tingle to her bone<br>
'Twas then she felt alone<br>
And wished that she'd gone straight<br>
And watched out for a simple twist of fate<br>
<br>
They walked along by the old canal<br>
Down Waterfront Street by the bell<br>
Stopped into the Riverfront hotel<br>
The desk clerk dressed in white<br>
With a face as black as night<br>
He said, &quot;Check out time's at eight&quot;<br>
Remember now 'bout that simple twist of fate<br>
<br>
He woke up and it sure was dim<br>
He could feel her eyes looking at him<br>
That's all right, but her chance was slim<br>
And in everyway he came pushing through<br>
He said, &quot;Baby, I'm leaving my heart with you,<br>
Take good care of it, and don't berate<br>
All about that simple twist of fate.&quot;<br>
<br>
Morning comes and she was there<br>
He could feel her climb on his hair<br>
But he couldn't see her anywhere<br>
And the dawn was coming up<br>
She dropped a coin into the cup<br>
Of a blind man at the gate<br>
And forgot about the simple twist of fate<br>
<br>
Oh for the times that are really slow<br>
He thought about just before she'd know<br>
He said I taught you everything you know<br>
So don't bother me no more<br>
I don't think you know where to find the door<br>
She said, 'No, I just can't wait'<br>
All about that that simple twist of fate<br>
<br>
People say that it's a crime<br>
To look commonly for too long a time<br>
She should have caught me in my prime<br>
She wouldn't leave that way<br>
'I'm leaving my heart with you and I can't stay<br>
I'm going where the winds are wet<br>
Always there upon a simple twist of fate'</p>
