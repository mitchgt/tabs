<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="3"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;</font></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Why bring together these two sound clips? (or, in
the context of a web page [until I get around to prepare the sound files]: <em>imagined</em>
sound clips)</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">In the case of the gregorian invitatory, we
&quot;know&quot; that this is about ritual, a Medieval liturgical ceremony. Likewise, the
&quot;good evening ladies and gentlemen&quot; thing is just as obviously an announcement
of a rock concert. So what do they have to do with each other? </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">The setting is of course different, but apart
from that, there are actually significant similarities between the two sound events. They
are both formalized ways, repeated exactly the same way every time, of introducing
communal actions that involve people in different roles that are more or less fixed. They
also involve an architectural space &#150; a room &#150; with certain specific
characteristics that are fitting or even necessary for the occasion, various props
necessary to complete the action, and they are both laden with meaning which goes beyond
the mere fulfillment of the action.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">In other words: according to this description,
they can both be seen as introductions to rituals, as &quot;calls to worship&quot;, as it
were. That is: they are ways to focus everyone&#146;s attention on ritual and all that it
entails.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">My point is not to say that a Dylan concert and a
medieval vespers service are <i>the same </i>kind of ritual, but rather to circle around
the double question: What will a ritualistic perspective add to the understanding of a
Dylan show? and vice versa: what may the application of this perspective on a Dylan show
add to the understanding of ritual? &#150; what is <i>really</i> ritual about a medieval
service; and what do we mean by <i>really ritual</i>?</font><font SIZE="4"><i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></i></font><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;</font></p>
<font SIZE="4"><i>

<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></i></font><font face="Garamond">The External Similarites: Ceremony </font></h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">It is not difficult (whether or not it is
meaningful, is a question to which I will return) to regard a Dylan show as a parallel to
a medieval church service. We&#146;ve already heard the invitatory. Since c. 1990 this
announcement, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen &#133;&quot;, has been repeated in exactly the
same way at just about every single concert &#150; to the extent that to the audience (or
congregation) it no longer is an announcement but an element belonging to the proper order
of things &#150; a liturgical item. <a href="footnotes_ritual.htm#[1]" target="footnotes">[1]</a>
But even what precedes the invitatory is fixed: the preparation of the hall with buckets
(literally) of Nag Champa incense, and portions of Aaron Copeland&#146;s Rodeo suite form
the sound system, while the audience (or congregation) fills up the venue; then house
lights off, invitatorium, and then &#150; then the show begins.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Even here there is a &quot;liturgy&quot;. A
common &#150; far too common &#150; phrase in reviews of Dylan shows is that he&#146;s so
unpredictable. A brief look at his setlists will reveal the opposite. A Dylan concert
always involves fixed and variable elements. During most of the 90s he always played All
Along the Watchtower as song #3, and other songs have had similarly fixed positions in the
ceremony over shorter or longer stretches of time. Then there is a group of songs that are
chosen among the songs that an &quot;average listener&quot; &#150; the ones who have three
or four Dylan albums at home &#150; would want to hear: Like A Rolling Stone, Blowin&#146;
in the Wind, Mr Tambourine Man etc. Finally, there is almost always one or two songs for
the die-hard fans: a rarely heard song from an obscure 80s album, an old hillbilly
standard or an unlikely cover song. All in all: a sequence of songs that could very well
be described in terms of the <i>ordinarium </i>and <i>proprium</i> of the medieval mass:
some songs that will be heard every night, like a Kyrie or a Credo, and others that belong
to the specific feast day, and which will make <i>that</i> particular show unique.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">During all this, the celebrant(s) and the
congregation alike perform certain acts, well aware of their respective roles. A Dylan
concert is usually a seated thing (maybe due to the average age of his faithful
fans&#133;) but after c. 2/3 of the show, there is the so-called stage rush: the moment
when, as if on a given sign, the initiated rush to the front of the stage, to spend the
rest of the concert at the Master&#146;s feet &#150; as a latter day communion.
Post-concert talk within this group of people tends to bring up whether or not one got
eye-contact with his Bobliness (or &#150; as a second best &#150; with one of the guitar
players; Tony, the bass player, doesn&#146;t count, since he smiles all the time anyway). </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="4"><i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></i></font><font face="Garamond">The Internal Similarities: Ideology </font></h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Dylan himself, then &#150; how does he relate to
all this? Ambiguously. This is mainly owing to the fact that he has a double role, being
both the celebrant <i>and</i> the object of veneration. On stage he acts with the
unemotionality of a celebrant who performs an office he knows goes beyond himself, thereby
underlining the &quot;objective&quot; character of the ceremony/concert, and downplaying
the personal: he hardly ever speaks on stage; he does move, but not with the normal
&quot;look-at-me&quot; gestures of your average rock star, but with quirky knee-bends,
looking like a cross between Elvis and a shy kid from Hibbing, Minnesota. He is just up
there, doing what he happens to do best: being &quot;just a song and dance man&quot; as he
expressed it - jokingly, but truthfully - in an interview in the mid-60s.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">At the same time, he is well aware that every
movement he makes is being monitored and interpreted by 7,000 pairs of eyes. One of his
more mysterious songs, <i>Dark Eyes </i>(1985) ends with the phrase &quot;A million faces
at my feet, and all I see are dark eyes&quot;, most easily interpreted as the
performer&#146;s reflection on how idolization looks from the idol&#146;s side. But two
other phrases in the song opens up for the possibility to regard the whole song as
something heard from high up on a cross: &quot;A cock is crowing far away and another
soldier's deep in prayer&quot;. &quot;The French girl, she's in paradise&quot; &#150; a
possible allusion to the thief on the cross. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">During his career Dylan has related himself to
this duality in different ways. Let me just point to three examples.</font></p>
<font SIZE="4"><i>

<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></i></font><font face="Garamond">The Rolling Thunder Review</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">During the late 1975 and the early 1976 Dylan
with friends went on the road with a show that was called the <i>Rolling Thunder Revue</i>.
The grand idea behind the tour was that it was supposed to be a never-ending touring
circus, where the artists on the bill would change all the time. The revue would also be
self-served with sound equipment etc. so that they could make landfall here and there
without much prior planning, and without having to go through the administrative treadmill
of managers, concert organizers etc. In this perspective, the RTR was an expression of
Dylan&#146;s wish to be nothing out of the ordinary, just another musician, at any time
replaceable with any other member of this creative community.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img src="isis.gif" width="307" height="375"
alt="isis.gif (171837 bytes)" align="right" vspace="2" hspace="10">One striking element of
these concerts was the use of masks and facial painting. Dylan would frequently come on
stage with his face painted white. A powerful scene from one of the concerts shows Dylan
holding his hands crossed in front of him, as an incantation. In other words: the concerts
involved a play with symbols of various kinds, symbols that are easily associated with
religious ritual, but without a clear symbolic background in the specific context in which
they were used. The gestures thus appear as signs removed from a sign system that can
render them understandable (which, on the other hand, does not preclude that they can
still be <i>meaningful</i>). A similar element is the quasi-religious connections made
throughout the tour to settings such as Gypsy mythology and Indian shamanism, etc.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">All this is closely related to the fact that
these concerts weren&#146;t <i>just </i>concerts, and the band wasn&#146;t <i>just </i>a
group of musicians. Dylan had brought a film crew on the road, and just about everything
that happened, on stage and behind it (and behind the tour bus), was filmed. The outcome
of this was the 4 hours long <i>cinema verité</i> opus <i>Renaldo and Clara</i>, which
was released in 1978. The film itself was an immediate failure. Be that as it may, the
meaning of the actions on stage go beyond that of a rock concert. The movie, the songs
that were newly written before the tour, as well as the &quot;drama&quot; that was
enacted, brought up the &quot;eternal questions&quot;: love, death, marriage, divorce,
violence, trust, children, identity. This is enacted in a meta-narrative taking place both
on stage and in some sort of reality, but lines between the world as lived and the world
as enacted <a href="footnotes_ritual.htm#[1b">[1b]</a> are blurred &#150; every statement
takes on a meaning which goes beyond the statement itself, because it belongs in all the
different contexts at the same time: both in the &quot;real&quot; and in the
&quot;transcendent&quot; media-/hyper-reality.</font><font SIZE="4"><i></p>

<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></i></font><font face="Garamond">The Gospel Years</font></h3>
<font SIZE="4"><i>

<p></i></font><font size="3" face="Garamond">Three years later, Dylan &quot;went
Christian&quot;. During the years 1979&#150;1981, when Dylan was associated with the
extreme evangelical Vineyard Fellowship in Tarzana, CA, and only performed new songs,
filled with evangelization and images of end-time apocalypse. The concerts from his
born-again period may, paradoxically enough, serve as a contrasting example to the RTR.
During the &quot;gospel years&quot; he made a direct connection with christian ritual, by
virtually turning his concerts into Christian services. In a way, however, this is the
period which is the least intersting from a ritual perspective, precisely for this reason:
the message was over-explicit, in the well-established tradition of evangelical preaching
&#150; there was little left of the transcendental message of the earlier tour, only a
message <em>about </em>the transcendental, which is a completely different thing.</font><font
SIZE="4"></p>

<h3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Garamond">The Voice of a Generation</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">The eptithet that has stuck most stubbornly to
Dylan throughout the decades is probably that of &quot;the Voice of a Generation&quot;.
The man who said things that many felt. The religious importance of this may be gauged
from the reactions when he stopped saying what at least some of his followers wanted him
to say, not primarily by &quot;going electric&quot;, but by leaving out the political
message from his songs. But in fact, he has always claimed to be uninterested in politics:
&quot;I&#146;m just into langauge. I pick up what&#146;s in the air, what&#146;s on
people&#146;s minds&quot; (Interview with Elliot Landy, Woodstock 1968).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Implicit in this, and in the examples above, is a
notion of the artist as a medium, as someone with special gifts who is thereby able to
pick up wisdom where others just see everyday reality &#150; the answer is blowin&#146; in
the wind.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">One might ask: what is the character of this
wisdom? And, again, the answer is dual, even the answers Dylan himself has given. On the
one hand, he sees himself as just any other guy who goes to work with what he&#146;s best
at: &quot;Basically, I&#146;m just a regular person. I don&#146;t walk around all the time
out of my mind with inspiration. So what can I tell you about that?&quot; (<em>Rolling Stone</em>,
Nov 22, 2001). Just a song-and-dance man, indeed.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">In an interview from 1978, where Dylan comments
upon <i>Renaldo and Clara,</i> we find this discussion about what he wants to do or not:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <font SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">D: Let&#146;s say you have a
    message: white is white. Bergman would say &quot;white is white&quot; in the space of an
    hour &#150; or what seems to be an hour. Bunuel might say &quot;white is black and black
    is white, but white is really white&quot;. And it&#146;s all really the same message.<br>
    Interviewer: And how would Dylan say it?<br>
    D: Dylan would probably not even say it. He&#146;d assume you&#146;d know that.</font></p>
    </font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font face="Garamond">

<p>If this is a way of saying that he does not have a &quot;profound&quot; message, Dylan
has at the same time &#150; at least in periods &#150; had a quite clear image of himself
as someone with a special gift. He comments upon a statment from Woody Guthrie, that all
the songs are already written, floating around in the universe, ready to be picked up:
&quot;In a certain sense, there is a great deal of veracity to that&quot; (MOJO feb.
1998). He uses a similar phrase to describe his own writing of <i>Desolation Row</i>: </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <font SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">BD: I don&#146;t know how it was
    done.<br>
    Kurt Loder: It just came to you?<br>
    BD: It just came out through me.</font></p>
    </font>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Concerning his currently, since 1988 ongoing
tour, he describes its origin in terms of a religious experience on stage: </font><font
SIZE="3"></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Garamond" SIZE="3">&quot;It&#146;s almost like I
    heard it as a voice. &#133; <i>I&#146;m determined to stand, whether God will deliver me
    or not</i>. And all of a sudden everything just exploded. &#133; After that is when I sort
    of knew: I&#146;ve got to go out and play these songs&quot; </font><font face="Garamond">(<font
    SIZE="3"><i>Newsweek</i> Oct 13, 1997). </font></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">And further:</font><font SIZE="3"></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&quot;I don&#146;t feel like what I do qualifies
    to be called a career. It&#146;s more of a calling&quot;. (RS, Nov 22, 2001) </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&quot;I don&#146;t get bored singing the songs
    because they have a truth to them. They have a life to them &#133; I don&#146;t think
    there is anybody playing the type of songs that we&#146;re playing.&quot; (MOJO feb 1998).
    </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&quot;I told you &quot;The Times They Are
    a'Changing&quot; and they did. I said the answer was &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and

    Albuquerque, Dec 5 1979)</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&quot;I don't think I'm gonna be really

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font SIZE="4">

<h2></font><font face="Garamond">&quot;Secular Religiosity&quot; </font></h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Is it a relevant term to use about this, to say
that Dylan is seen &#150; both by himself and by his audience &#150; as a secular prophet
for a modern world? This would in turn imply a notion of &quot;secular religion&quot;, but
what is that, if at all anything?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">In the present context, I would point out at
least three areas where such a concept would be meaningful in ways that at least
approximate that of religious services. One is the notion of a transcendental truth,
revealed and administered by the artistic medium. This function is the prerequisite of the
other two: that of creating a community and a sense of connection, and that of serving as
the &quot;soundtrack of our lives&quot;, to fall back on a cliché often used about Dylan
&#150; as that which defines our identity as historical beings, that through which our
experiences are anchored to the continuum of societal time. The validity of the two latter
functions ultimately hinges on the experience that what the man is saying is right, and
&#150; possibly &#150; relevant and important for one&#146;s life.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Even here, there&#146;s an ambiguity inherent in
it. The strong status of the truth of this revelation stands in stark contrast with the
contents of the revealed &quot;truth&quot; itself: &quot;Don&#146;t follow leaders&quot;,
&quot;You don&#146;t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows&quot; etc. In an
interview from 1984, these two opposing approaches appear in the same part of the
discussion: </font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <font SIZE="3"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">I mean, if I didn&#146;t have
    anything different to say to people, then what would be the point of it? </font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">[ . . . ]</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">anybody who expects anything from me is just a
    borderline case [ . . . ] You can&#146;t keep on depending on one person to give you
    everything.</font></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Apart from the logical sophistry that can be
performed on this &#150; which addressee does he have in mind who could in any way listen
to the message without by necessity violating it? <a href="footnotes_ritual.htm#[2]">[2] </a>&#150;
this is also an indication of the &quot;ritual&quot; aspect of these songs, at least as
part of his current live repertory: their effect is partly based upon the assumption that
words that were laid down a long time ago, can transcend their own historical situation,
and can even transmit an esoteric, or at least &quot;deeper&quot; meaning, which goes
beyond the words themselves and the acts of performing and listening to them.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">In all these areas it is possible to regard Dylan
in the light of medieval representational liturgy &#150; as the one around whom a
community forms and through whom the community partakes in the revelation.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">What makes it particularly relevant to bring up
this in a medievalistic context, beyond the loose analogy of cultural phenomena, is the
setting in which this is presented: the concert genre. This way of presenting music has in
itself firm roots back to medieval ritual. The polyphonic mass of the late Middle Ages,
the <i>Abendmusiken</i> and the church recitals in seventeenth-century protestant cities,
and, last but not least, the cult of the genius in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
are all practices where it is hard to draw sharp lines between the religious and secular
functions of the music &#150; between worship and enjoyment.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">What comes in addition to this general aspect of <i>Kunstreligion</i>
inherent in the concert genre itself, is the bringing together of this tradition with
popular culture, in its two incarnations, as folk culture and mass culture. Dylan &#150;
along with other artists &#150; has started over again, so to speak: from a genre which
was originally functional in a way similar to medieval ritual music, only fulfilling other
functions, such as dance music, the &quot;news reports&quot; of a folk ballad, or the pure
entertainment, has evolved a new concert genre where, at least to some extent, the music
is the carrier of the &quot;real&quot; message, in a way that is comparable to the
aestheticization of the functional mass music in the fifteenth century.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">This is a genre that spans the whole continuum
from mindless entertainment &#150; even the commercial mass appeal, as evidenced by the
blatant advertisment of the Columbia Recording Company in the &quot;invitatory&quot;
&#150; to the deepest seriousness, which encompasses meaningfulness, world view and
ideology. A Dylan audience is usually very quiet, hanging on to every word that comes from
the stage. But there is also dancing in the aisles, and visits to the bar (and,
consequently, to the restroom) by the less faithful. Thus, a Dylan concert has fundamental
similarities with, but also differences from, e.g. a Britney Spears concert, in that it
takes it <i>raison d&#146;étre</i> (as a genre) from the common understanding that
something is offered which goes beyond entertainment. The action carries a level of
meaning which transcends the surface level of the action.</font><font SIZE="4"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;</font></p>

<h2><font face="Garamond">Ite, missa est</font></h2>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">We can now return to the question implied in the
introduction: <i>is</i> a Dylan show <i>&quot;really&quot;</i> a ritual?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">The ambiguities I have pointed to in connection
with Dylan correspond with a fundamental ambiguity in the lexical definition of ritual.
The latin word <i>ritus</i> has two different meanings. The first definition is relatively
unproblematic in relation to a medieval service: <i>the form and manner of religious
observances; a religious usage</i> or <i>ceremony</i>, <i>a rite</i>. But when we talk
about ritual today, we usually mean more than that: various ritual scholars have
emphasised things like the connection with myth and the way ritual and myth consitute the
world view of a culture. And in everyday language, just about any action that is repeated
the same way every time, and where the way it is done is ascribed some kind of meaning,
can be called a ritual. This corresponds with the second definition: <i>a custom</i>, <i>usage</i>,
<i>manner</i>, <i>mode</i>, <i>way</i>. Ritual, then, is no longer a religious term.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">It would be difficult to claim that a Dylan show
entails religious observance &#150; there are no ontological overtones, no dogmatics, no
&quot;theology&quot; (or &quot;bobology&quot;).<a href="footnotes_ritual.htm#[3]">[3]</a>
But still, the fact that surprisingly many people lead their lives, make their choices in
life and form their outlook on life in accordance with what Dylan says, does, sings, means
&#150; not just by nodding symphathetically to the words of his songs, but in more
profound ways &#150; indicates an approach that borders on the religious.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Mutatis mutandis &#150; and with no further
comparison &#150; the anthropologist Diana Smay has suggested that the dramatic rise in
cases of obsessive compulsive disorder over the past fifty year or so, may be related to
the abandonment of traditional &#150; religious &#150; forms of ritual in the Western
civilization. I&#146;m not sure if I subscribe to her entire line of argument, in
particular her suggestion of a biological basis for ritual behavior seems problematic. But
apart from that, her overall approach to the question of ritual is intriguing.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">Dylan fandom ranges from the deep appreciation of
a musical and lyrical artistic production, to the almost religious obsession with
everything that is related to him. But both extremes imply both the sense of community
created by repeated, communal activities, and the resonance of one&#146;s own experiences
with expressions &#150; musical, literary or others &#150; that have acquired a canonical
status.</font></p>
<font FACE="Garamond">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If these three criteria &#150; community, iterativity and canonicity
&#150; together with the ascription of meaning of a kind that goes beyond what actions are
actually taking place, in any way comes close to a modern understanding of what
constitutes a ritual, and an understanding which can also be applied to medieval religious
ceremonies, then there is certainly a connection between the two, despite the distance in
