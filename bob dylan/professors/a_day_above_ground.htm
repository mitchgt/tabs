<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bob Dylan &#150; the &quot;voice of a generation&quot; in the 1960s,
the self-appointed gypsy and divorce poet in the 70s, the sulphur-fuming prophet in the
years around 1980, who through a series of mediocre albums in the following years lost
whatever he may have had left of commercial status&#151;what does he have to say today,
forty years after he first entered the stage? Quite a lot, actually.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1997 Dylan released <i>Time Out Of Mind</i>, which not only became
his best-selling album ever, but which was also generally lauded, by critics and fans
alike. The follow-up <i>Love and Theft</i> has already positioned itself at the top of the
charts, and all worried predictions that Dylan would do as he usually has done: follow up
a masterpiece with an unengaged embarrassment, have been put to rest. </font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="4"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dylan and Christianity, Woman and Love</font><font FACE="Garamond"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Dylan issued the album <i>Slow Train Coming</i> in 1979, it was a
surprise to most of his fans: the protest singer, beatnik, former Jew even, had converted
to Christianity, and to one of the more extremely evangelist directions, at that: the
Vineyard Fellowship in California. The message that is conveyed on <i>Slow Train Coming</i>
and the two following albums, <i>Saved </i>and <i>Shot of Love</i>, is uncompromising. The
lyrics, especially on <i>Slow Train</i>, are marked by the strong conviction that we are
living in the endtimes and that Judgement Day is just around the corner. </p>

<p>As it turned out, that particular day didn&#146;t dawn (although Dylan himself saw the
events in Afghanistan in 1980 as a confirmation of his exegesis of the end time profecy of
the Revelation), and the original fire gradually changed into a more nuanced understanding
of Christianity, in which there was room for more than dystopias and over-zealous
evangelization. In the years since, there have been much speculation about Dylan&#146;s
religion. To the extent that religious themes have occurred in his lyrics, the threads
have gone to Jewish just as much as to Christian thought. [<i>Infidels</i> (1983) contains
the song &quot;Neighbourhood Bully&quot;, which is an open defense of Israel; &quot;Not
Dark Yet&quot; from <i>Time Out Of Mind</i> (1997) contains a direct quotation from a
talmudic rabbi, and the same is the case with Dylan&#146;s acceptance speech at the Grammy
show in 1991. ]<sup> </sup>At the same time, he has on several occasions stated that he
does not believe in organized religious communities: &quot;I find the religiosity and
philosophy in the music. &#133; I don&#146;t adhere to rabbis, preachers, evangelists, all
of that. I&#146;ve learned more from the songs than I&#146;ve learned from any of this
kind of entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe in the songs&quot;<sup> (</sup>Newsweek,
Oct 6, 1997).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several authors have pointed to another motive that seems to have been
inseparable from Dylan&#146;s religiosity: Woman and Love. Dylan&#146;s own salvation
history can be read as the story of the development of his relation to these two, which
for Dylan are almost one and the same. Not only was it through a woman (the actor Mary
Alice Artes) that Dylan came in touch with the evangelic Christianity. This is also a
topic that recurs in many of the songs, both from the time of his conversion and the years
before it: the redemption, salvation even, through carnal love. In a song like
&quot;Shelter from the Storm&quot; from <i>Blood on the Tracks </i>(1975) Dylan gives the
I-character christological overtones (&quot;In a little hilltop village they gambled for
my clothes &#133; &#145;Come in,&#146; she said, &#145;I&#146;ll give you shelter from the
storm&#146;&quot;), while the association between salvation and earthly, carnal love is
explicit also in the songs after his conversion (&quot;Change My Way Of Thinking&quot; on <i>Slow
Train Coming</i>, 1979 has: &quot;I got a God-fearing woman, One I can easily afford / She
can do the Georgia Crawl, She can walk in the spirit of the Lord&quot;) [The exact content
of the expression &quot;the Georgia Crawl&quot; is unclear, but its sexual connotations
are not. Dylan has proabably taken it from Blind Willie McTell&#146;s &quot;Broke Down
Engine&quot;, which he recorded in the early 90s: &quot;What made me love my woman, she
can really do the Georgia Crawl.&quot;]. </font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="4"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Analysing Dylan lyrics</font><font FACE="Garamond"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dylan is often credited for having brought <i>meaning</i> into popular
music through his lyrics. That is not the same as saying that it&#146;s always clear what
his songs <i>mean</i>. On the contrary, Dylan&#146;s poetics is based on a resistance
against clear-cut meanings; instead he puts together seemingly unrelated images,
characters and situations in a collage which becomes confusing if one searches for exact
meanings. But if one lets that go, it is easier to approach his technique: some of his
greatness as a poet lies in his ability to serve the listener with a web of associations
and semi-graspable connections, in a way that imitates how the mind works, and which
therefore gives the listener a point of departure for <i>creating </i>meaning, which by
far exceeds what &#145;meaningful&#146; lyrics, which say what they want to say but
nothing more, can give.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the texts that is often mentioned in this connection, is
&quot;Desolation Row&quot; (1965), which may serve as an example here, both of
Dylan&#146;s technique and of my own analytical vantage point. The song begins:
&quot;They&#146;re selling postcards of the hanging, they&#146;re painting the passports
brown. The beauty-parlor&#146;s filled with sailors, the circus is in town.&quot; The cast
that glides by in the song, is slightly surrealistic: Einstein disguised as Robin Hood,
Dr. Filth with his world in a leather cup, the death-romantic Ophelia, Cinderella as a
street-sweeper, Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot fighting it out on the Titanic. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What, then, do these brown-painted passes <i>mean</i>? Is it a grand
metaphor of suppression in the modern society, an expression of the status of art, or
something completely different? It is hard to tell, first and foremost because Dylan
usually does not take his images and metaphors from coherent motivic circles, which would
have opened up for &#145;holistic&#146; interpretations where the motives support each
other. I therefore prefer a simplistic model of interpretation, where &#145;brown
passports&#146; means &#145;brown passports&#146;, Cinderella is Cinderella, and Romeo is
the lover of Juliet, and then see what happens. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not as simple as it may sound: in order to do this, we must
first know what a brown passport really is, which involves all the associations we have to
each of the words, the connection between them and between similar concepts that are
invariably actualized in the juxtaposition of these concepts: &#145;brown passport&#146;
then becomes the outcome of the cluster of meaning
&#145;colour&#151;identity&#151;document&#146;, etc., with all the layers of symbols and
associations that each of these brings with it&#151;in short: a never ending chain of
connections that can in principle not be delineated: in the end it embraces our entire
world and world view, seen from one perspective: that of the brown passports.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually it is not meaningful to stretch this horizon of understanding
and interpretation beyond the song itself and its references to someone&#146;s
(Dylan&#146;s, the listeners) reality. [The &#146;Dylanologist&#146; A. J. Weberman, who
was in close (too close, in Dylan&#146;s opinion) contact with Dylan in the early 70s, has
made attempts to read a consistent symbolic language into Dylan&#146;s texts, so that
&#145;rain&#146; always means e.g. &#145;war&#146; or &#145;heroin&#146; etc., but this
can hardly be regarded as more than a curiosity. Central to his &#145;investigation&#146;
was a methodical scrutinizing of Dylan&#146;s garbage, in the search for discarded
scribblings and other important material. Weberman&#146;s interpretations stem from an
obsession to prove that Dylan is a drug addict and that he has AIDS. They used to be
accesible on the web site <a HREF="http://www.dylanology.com/">www.dylanology.com</a>, but
he has not been able to maintain it, apparently because he&#146;s in jail&#151;for drug
crimes.] A close reading of <i>Love and Theft</i>, however, seems to support an
interpretation of the entire album as a more or less unified whole, where certain central
motives turn up in song after song, weaving themselves around and within each other
throughout the record: the main motives are the same, but their value changes, gets
reverted: the important becomes unimportant, the innocent becomes dangerous, and what
remains when a song is over, changes from song to song, depending on which motives are
connected, and how. Sometimes several motives are combined in an action- and idea-packed
narrative of great dramatic force, other times the &quot;narrative&quot; comes to a halt,
and the world is regarded from one single perspective&#151;be it good or bad&#151;that
dominates entirely. This can perhaps be likened to the function of the aria in opera:
characters steps out of the action for a moment, to present their view of things, from <i>their
</i>perspective.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motivic web even extends beyond the songs on this album, and
include both Dylan&#146;s earlier production, and a more general Western symbolic
universe, above all the Christian and the American, and the combination of these: the
Christianization of &#145;Americana&#146;.<sup> </sup>[It is not a coincidence that Dylan
in recent years has expanded his catalogue with a number of songs by the profoundly
Christian <i>and </i>profoundly American bluegrass group The Stanley Brothers, with titles
such as &quot;Hallelujah, I&#146;m ready to go&quot; and &quot;I&#146;m the Man,
Thomas&quot; (&quot;Look at the nail scars here in my hand&quot;).]</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The primary legitimation for using a model of analysis like this, which
might easily turn into a self-fulfilling hunt for hidden connections, is that this
procedure has a precursor in Dylan&#146;s own production. The four-hour film <i>Renaldo
&amp; Clara </i>from 1978 was composed around motives, characters, colours, symbols, in a
similar manner. Allen Ginsberg witnessed the process, and explains the working method as
follows: </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  </font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He shot about 110 hours of film
  or more, and he looked at all the scenes. Then he put all the scenes on index cards,
  according to some preconceptions he had when he was directing the shooting. Namely,
  themes: God, rock &amp; roll, art, poetry, marriage, women, sex, Bob Dylan, poets,
  death&#151;maybe eighteen or twenty thematic preoccupations. Then he also put on index
  cards all the different characters, as well as scenes. He also marked on index cards the
  dominant color&#151;blue or red &#133; and certain other images that go through the movie,
  like the rose and the hat, and Indians&#151;American Indian&#151;so that he finally had a
  cross-file of all that. And then he went through it all again and began composing it,
  thematically, weaving these specific compositional references in and out. So it&#146;s
  compositional, and the idea was not to have a &#145;plot&#146;, but to have a composition
  of those themes (quoted from Clinton Heylin: <i>Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades. Take two</i>,
  Penguin Books, p. 460).</p>
  </font><font FACE="Garamond">
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will particularly emphasize three such motives on <i>Love and Theft</i>.
They can be called: The Apocalypse, The River, and Love. Along the way, several others
will turn up.</font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="4"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Apocalypse</font><font FACE="Garamond"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The apocalyptic is the carrying motive in two of the songs, which can
be regarded as the pillars around which the whole album and its motivic threads spin:
&quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;Highwater (for Charley Patton)&quot; [That the album
reached the stores in the morning of September 11th, 2001, the same day and hour as the
assault on the World Trade Center in New York, makes the album&#146;s apocalyptic strand
even more prominent, but as was mentioned, this has been a strong preoccupation for Dylan
throughout his carreer]. The outer connection between the two songs is evident: Highwater
takes its point of departure in Charley Patton&#146;s description of the big flood in
Mississippi in 1927&#151;the Apocalypse in American form [Charley Patton (1891&#150;1934)
was one of the &quot;Fathers of the Delta blues&quot; (for biographical references, see
e.g. Robert Santelli: <i>The Big Book of Blues: A Biographical Encyclopedia</i>, London:
Pavilion, 1994.. Patton&#146;s life style follows all the cliches for a &quot;blues
man&quot;: he was raw and bullyish, enjoyed a good fight, drank heavily, allegedly had
eight wives and spent time in prison. His guitar style and song technique had an enormous
influence on virtually every blues musicians in the following generation, and is both
directly and indirectly a model for Dylan&#146;s own blues style. Patton&#146;s &quot;High
Water Everywhere&quot; is a long description of the flood, even this a topic that Dylan
has treated earlier, e.g. in &quot;Crash on the Levee&quot; and the parodic &quot;The Big
Flood&quot;, both from the 1967 Basement Tapes).]. This is a prominent feature in both
songs. In Highwater it is the thread that goes through the whole song, dominating it to
the degree that whatever positive bits of thread that are weaved in, lose their good
appearance and become twisted images: <i>Dance</i>: &quot;You dancing with whom they tell
you to, or you don&#146;t dance at all&quot; [This article was written before the official
lyrics were available. All quotations from the album are my own, inofficial,
transcriptions, and they may be erroneous]; <i>Art</i>: &quot;I can write you poems, make
a strong man lose his mind&quot;; <i>Justice</i>: &quot;Judge says to the High Sherriff:
&quot;I want him dead or alive, either way, I don&#146;t care&quot;; <i>God</i>:
&quot;I&#146;m preaching the word of God, I&#146;m putting out your eyes&quot;. Love
seemingly keeps its good connotations (&quot;I just can&#146;t be happy, love, unless
you&#146;re happy too&quot;), but still: this is an ambiguous message: he isn&#146;t
actually saying that he&#146;s happy, only that <i>he </i>can&#146;t be happy unless <i>she
</i>is, and judging from the gloomy mood of the song, there really isn&#146;t any reason
why she would be. All that remains is the threat of the not-lasting, destruction, the
Apocalyptic&#151;hammered in through the refrains: &quot;It&#146;s tough out there&quot;,
&quot;Things are breaking up out there&quot;, &quot;I don&#146;t care&quot;,
&quot;It&#146;s bad out there&quot;, &quot;It&#146;s rough out there&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, Highwater isn&#146;t primarily a song about a natural
disaster. Rather, the physical calamity is the metaphorical starting point for the <i>real</i>
topic of the song: the way people react and interact when they are left to themselves in a
pressured situation (be it flood or love), where the solitude and the pressure are allowed
to dominate: &quot; &#145;Don&#146;t reach out for me,&#146; she said, &#145;Can&#146;t
you see I&#146;m drowning too?&#146; &quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Highwater is a monothematic movement <i>á la </i>Haydn, both lyrically
and musically. Just as the feeling of disaster pervades the lyrics, so the sound is dark
an monotonous. The verses are dominated by a solitary banjo, which not primarily (but
also) is a reminiscing gesture to Patton and the delta-blues; even more, it underlines the
loneliness and hopelessness in the song itself: it fills its part of the soundscape, high
above the rest of the sonorous field and without any contact with it, where its manical
plucking over a sustained chord turns into a musical representation of the nightmare
situation where you run and run without ever getting anywhere. The refrains are
accompanied by ominous thunder in the drums and growls from deep male voices.</font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="4"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The River</font><font FACE="Garamond"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Mississippi&quot; is dramatically different, despite the common
point of departure. Even here the Apocalyptic is the framework for the narrative,
established already in the second line of the song: &quot;Your days are numbered an so are
mine &#133; Nowhere to escape,&quot; and: &quot;Sky full of fire, pain pouring down&quot;.
The song culminates in wreckage and death: &quot;Well, my ship's been split to splinters
and it's sinking fast. I'm drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But still, &quot;Mississippi&quot; is a fundamentally positive,
life-inspiring song. The difference from Highwater is noticable already in the music:
Highwater is dark and heavy, Mississippi has one of the few ascending bass lines in
Dylan&#146;s production (with prominent exceptions, such as &#145;Like a Rolling
Stone&#146;), and a lighter sound overall. But even more interesting are the lyrical
differences. Again, the disaster situation is rather to be interpreted as a human (and
inter-human) condition, but unlike Highwater&#146;s isolated fates, it is instead the <i>possibility</i>
of communication that is explored. The River is still the river of flood and drowning, but
at the same time it is used as an image of the Crossing of boundaries (&quot;I crossed
that river just to be where you are&quot;). If we bring the two together, we get a complex
metaphor of the dangers of being close to someone&#151;a human-life version of the
Biblical 70,000 fathoms, if one likes: approaching another human being is a voluntary
matter (&quot;some people will offer you their hand, and some won&#146;t&quot;, as it is
said in the second verse), but doing so entails a danger, one enters unknown territory,
and there is no way back (&quot;You can always come back, but you can&#146;t come back all
the way&quot;, third verse). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A development seems to take place within the song, concerning the
possibility of communication, from &quot;We&#146;re all boxed in&quot; in the first verse
to &quot;Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow&quot; in the last. One of the steps
through which this development goes, is the insight: &quot;All my powers of expression, my
thoughts so sublime, could never do you justice in reason or rhyme&quot; [This can be seen
as yet another one of the small motifs that recur here and there on the record, which in
this case may (possibly) be traced back to Petrarch&#146;s Canto 332, <i>Mia benigna
fortuna</i>: <i>I miei gravi sospir non vanno in rime, e &#146;l mio duro martir vince
ogni stile</i> (&quot;and my heavy sighs can not be brought into rhyme, and my hard fate
conquers every style&quot;). In &quot;Mississippi&quot; the narrator takes Petrarch&#146;s
position: Love cannot be described, captured in poetry, whereas in &quot;Bye And Bye&quot;
he states, seemingly matter-of-factly, that &quot;I&#146;m singing love&#146;s praises in
sugar-coated rhyme&quot; (see below). It is not obvious that Dylan has known these lines
from Petrarch, but there is in fact a more or less direct link between them, which at
least invites speculation: in Tangled Up In Blue (1975) the I-person follows a woman home
to her place, where she reads for him from a &quot;book of poems written by an Italian
poet from the thirteenth century&quot;. Well, Petrarch didn&#146;t live in the thirteenth
century, but in an interview Dylan once intimated, in his usual, anti-intellectual way,
that the poet&#146;s name is &quot;Plutarch&quot; (Dylan: &quot;I like that song. Yeah,
that poet from the 13th Century.&quot; McGregor: &quot;Who was that?&quot; Dylan:
&quot;Plutarch. Is that his name?&quot; McGregor: &quot;Yeah&quot;. Craig McGregor
interview, 12 March 1978. Published in New Musical Express on 22 April 1978). Even
thematically Petrarch seems to be a likely candidate, with his personal relation, rich in
contrasts, to Woman, not unlike what Dylan expresses in other songs. That the quoted line
has been of a certain import for Dylan, appears, not only from it being the emotional
climax of &quot;Tangled up in Blue&quot;, but also from the fact that after his
conversion, fall 1978, precisely this line was re-written: now, the quotes are from the
Bible and Jeremiah.].</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only the border towards other people is crossed, but also the
limits of time. Even here there&#146;s a development through the song, from a perception
of time as a physical burden (&quot;time&#146;s piling up&quot;), to an almost Augustinian
concept of time, where time, in the moment of crossing, disappears completely (&quot;got
no future, got no past&quot;) [Augustine&#146;s discussion of time, where he concludes
that neither the past nor the present exists, other than in memory, can be found in his <i>Confessiones</i>,
book 11.].</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All through the song, the boundary-crossing is represented as a
journey, and here lies the main difference between &quot;Mississippi&quot; and
&quot;Highwater&quot;: in &quot;Highwater&quot; the protagonist is content with his
closedness and standstillness&#151;and it all ends in disaster; <i>here</i>, on the
contrary, the <i>necessity</i> of the journey is emphasised (&quot;Everybody got to move
somewhere&quot;), both related to communication and to time, and through the insight about
this necessity (which despite its hints at &#145;fate&#146;s decree&#146; nevertheless
does not end up in fatalism, because it is based on the necessity of choice), the fearful
in the disaster dissolves. Therefore the apocalyptic climax in the central
&quot;wreck-scene&quot; quoted above, ends in reconciliation and harmonious redemption,
not in fear: &quot;But my heart is not weary, it's light and it&#146;s free. I got nothing
but affection for those who&#146;ve sailed with me&quot;&#151;one of the most loving lines
Dylan has ever written.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Likewise, in Mississippi the presence of evil is counterbalanced by the
good, and, unlike in Highwater, the good is allowed to stand for itself: Higwhater&#146;s
ambiguous concern is here explicit and clear: &quot;I know you&#146;re sorry, I&#146;m
sorry too&quot;. Thus, even though the last verse brings drowning and death as a
consequence of the Crossing, and ends with the refrain &quot;I stayed in Mississippi a day
too long&quot;, it is still the tender declarations of love that remain when the song is
over: &quot;give me your hand and say you&#146;ll be mine&quot;&#151;in dramatical
contrast to Highwater&#146;s &quot;Don&#146;t reach out for me, can&#146;t you see
I&#146;m drowning too?&quot;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two further motives are worth mentioning, because they show up in other
songs as well. The transformation from the &quot;Highwater&quot;ian isolationism to the
last verse&#146;s empathy goes through the lines: &quot;Walking through the leaves falling
from the trees, feeling like a stranger nobody sees.&quot; The same foliage shows up time
after time on the album, as a symbol of comprehension&#151;either the one not reached, as
in &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; (&quot;Last night the wind was whispering, I was trying
to make out what it was&quot;), or the appropriated, dogmatic truth of &quot;Tweedle Dee
and Tweedle Dum&quot;: &quot;They walk among the stately trees They know the secrets of
the breeze&quot;, see below). As a motive, this reaches back to at least two earlier Dylan
songs: &quot;Blowin&#146; in the wind&quot; from 1962&#151;the answer is there, in the
wind, for whoever so wishes to pick it up, but at the same time: who can catch the
wind?&#151;and &quot;A Hard Rain&#146;s A-Gonna Fall&quot;: &quot;I heard ten thousand
whispering and nobody listening.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Tree&quot; is in itself a motive with branches in many
directions, appearing both as one element of the idyll in &quot;Floater&quot;, with leaves
rustling in a mild summer breeze and logs crackling on the hearth, and as menacing ghosts
in the concealed <i>murder ballad </i>&quot;Moonlight&quot; (&quot;The branches cast their
shadows over stone. Won&#146;t you meet me out in the moonlight alone&quot;) [This last
motive is also closely related to the culminating lines in another classic Dylan song,
&quot;Mr Tambourine Man&quot; (1965): &quot;Take me disappearing through the smoke rings
of my mind, / down the foggy ruins of time, / far past the frozen leaves, / The haunted,
frightened trees, / out to the windy beach, / Far from the twisted reach of crazy
sorrow.&quot; Here the Tree offers a whole chain of images in a <i>rite de passage</i>
away from &quot;the twisted reach of crazy sorrow&quot;, out to the freedom on the beach,
where on can dance &quot;with one hand waving free&quot;. (As an aside, one might, at
least in a parenthesis, wonder when was the last time Dylan himself did that; his
present-day persona doesn&#146;t invite that kind of images. Then again, that&#146;s his
concern only.)]. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, one of the Journey associations in &quot;Mississippi&quot;, is,
maybe surprisingly, the Journey motives in the Biblical Christmas narrative. Both the wise
men&#151;&quot;I got here following the southern star&quot;&#151;and Mary&#146;s
mule&#151;&quot;Well, the devil's in the alley, mule's in the stall&quot;&#151;are
represented. In &quot;Floater&quot; too, the Christmas motive shows up, as one of the
joyful memories of the untroubled past (&quot;I had &#146;em [i.e. dreams and hopes] once,
though, I suppose, / To go along with all the ring dancing, Christmas Carols on all the
Christmas Eves&quot;).</font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="4"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Love</font><font FACE="Garamond"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several of the other songs treat motives that may be referred to the
Love motive in different ways. What they have in common is that they&#151;again like opera
arias&#151;choose one perspective at the time, and try them out.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an interview from 1981 Dylan comments on a phrase in one of his new
songs&#151;&quot;the politics of sin&quot;&#151;saying that &quot;Yes, that&#146;s what
sin is: politics&quot; [From an interview by Neil Spencer: &quot;The diamond voice
within&quot;, <i>New Musical Express</i>,<i> </i>5. August, 1981, s. 29&#150;31. Quoted
from <a HREF="http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/81-aug15.htm">http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/81-aug15.htm</a>].
In &quot;Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee&quot; he characterizes this version of the political
man. The characters are borrowed from Lewis Carroll&#146;s <i>Through The Looking Glass</i>,
where they are the archetypical unruly brothers: well attuned to each other, but just as
quickly at each others&#146; throats, if necessary&#151;or if just so happens; not really
evil, rather indifferent, unaffected, careless. In a central scene they recite the poem
&quot;The walrus and the carpenter&quot; [In connection with Dylan it is almost impossible
not to associate the title with Dylan himself, whose original surname was Zimmermann
(&#145;carpenter&#146;), and John Lennon with his song &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;, which
was based on the same poem] for Alice, where it is hard to tell who of the protagonists is
the most greedy: one grabs <i>most</i> but the other one eats <i>as much as he can</i>
(Alice concludes: &quot;they were <i>both </i>very unpleasant characters&quot;.)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dylan&#146;s couple isn&#146;t much better. Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee
are in the mason&#146;s trade (&quot;They run a brick and tile company&quot;), and they
fulfill every cliché about the slightly mafiotic craftsman with affairs on the side, who
owns the world and takes what he wants: &quot;Looking at a window with a pecan pie / Lot
of things they'd like they would never buy&quot;. They own the truth in the same manner
(&quot;They know the secret of the breeze&quot;). When they &quot;trust their fate to the
hands of God&quot;, they don&#146;t do so in religious confidence, but in somnambulous
indifference&#151;<i>they </i>certainly don&#146;t feel any need to take fate in their own
hands, but if he up there want&#146;s to, that&#146;s entirely up to him. They&#146;re
living in &quot;the land of Nod&quot;&#151;the land to which Cain was exiled after his
fratricide. And it is not a nice neighbourhood that is presented in the song. All traces
of love and good thoughts are twisted, with money as the only measurement of value, if at
all there is one: &quot;I got love for you, and it's all in vain&quot;, &quot;My pretty
baby, she's looking around. She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.&quot; &quot;Well,
they're living in a happy harmony &#133; They're one day older and a dollar short, They
got a paid permit and a police escort&quot;. The song is full of bizarre images and
scenes, culled from the border land between the horror cabinet and the boy pranks:
&quot;Brains in a pot, they're beginning to boil / They're dripping with garlic and olive
oil,&quot; &quot;They're throwing knives into the tree / Two big bags of dead man's
bones.&quot; The song ends with a final assessment of their relationship: &quot;Tweedle
Dee is a low-down sorry old man. / Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand. /
&#145;I've had too much of your company,&#146; / Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Floater (too much to ask)&quot; is in a way a counter-image to
&quot;Tweedle Dum&quot;. Throughout most of the song, we are presented with a relaxed,
almost idyllic mood, where bees are buzzing, leaves are stirring, and trees inspire
neither insight nor fear, but simply heat, as firewood (&quot;There&#146;s a new grove of
trees on the outskirt of town &#133; /Timber, two foot six across, / burns with the bark
still on. &#133; You can smell the pine wood burning.&quot;)</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though the River isn&#146;t explicitly mentioned in the lyrics, it
is apparent that the story takes place by the riverside, and the very title of the song
points to yet another aspect of the River as a metaphor: that which floats by, always and
never the same. The &quot;Floater&quot; existence should not be misunderstood as carefree,
but the cares are not given any importance. Motives that in other connections (other
songs) become fatal or problematic, just float by, not unnoticed, but without import, with
comments like: &quot;It doesn&#146;t matter in the end&quot; and &quot;We will just have
to see how it goes.&quot; Some of the verses sound like comments on other songs.
&quot;They [perhaps the flood victims in &quot;Highwater&quot;?] say times are hard, / It
don&#146;t bother me, times are hard everywhere / We will just have to see how it
goes.&quot; &quot;One of the bosses&#146; hangers-on [Tweedle Dum or Tweedle Dee?], trying
to bully you, strong-arm you, inspire you with fear: / it has the opposite effect.&quot;
The wind, which elsewhere make leaves whisper and boats sink, is here almost ridiculed:
&quot;Sometimes it&#146;s just plain stupid / to get into any kind of wind.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The perhaps most beautiful strophe tells lovingly about the
grandparents: &quot;My grandfather was a duck-trapper / he could do it with just dragnets
and ropes. / My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth, / I don&#146;t know if
they had any dreams or hopes.&quot; This description flows straight into a rejection of
such things as dreams or hopes on the part of the narrator: &quot;I had them once, though,
I suppose&quot;. And the context in which the strophe occurs, is far from idyllic: to
begin with, he states that &quot;If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path
again, / you do so at the peril of your own life. / I&#146;m not as cool or forgiving as I
sound&quot;. What is described is a breakup scene; a demanding partner is thrown out, and
the unyieldingness involved in this, stands in sharp contrast to the seemingly peaceful
mood elsewhere in the song. But this is the central motive in &quot;Floater&quot;&#151;the
cool, disinterested observation, as a price to pay to get away from the deeper problems.
Both the price and the reward are paid in hopes and dreams: he has escaped them, but also
had to let them go.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We find some of the &quot;Floater&quot; mood also in &quot;Bye and
Bye&quot;, only with the contrasts drawn to an even stronger extreme. Most of the song is
dominated by an uncritical carefreeness, as an example of the above-mentioned phrase
&quot;I&#146;m singing love&#146;s praises in sugar coated rhymes&quot;, and supported
musically by the light swing-jazz arrangement. The last of these &#145;sugar-coated
rhymes&#146; is: &quot;You were my first love, and you will be my last&quot;. But the very
last strophe brutally turns the whole situation upside down, and all of a sudden we are
back in the apocalyptic verbiage, this time explicitly connected with a love relation.</font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="2"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Papa gone mad, mama she&#146;s feeling sad.<br>
  I&#146;m gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more<br>
  I&#146;m gonna establish my rule through civil war<br>
  Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be!</p>
  </font><font FACE="Garamond">
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same sudden shift to a violent reaction in a seemingly calm and
peaceful situation, can be found in just about every song on the album. &quot;Lonesome Day
Blues&quot; presents, in strophe after strophe, lost relationships, all in accordance with
the first line of the song: &quot;Today has been a sad and lonesome day.&quot; Twice
motives from &quot;Floater&quot; turn up: family ties, with the straightforward and honest
&quot;I wish my mother was still alive&quot; (Dylan&#146;s own mother died in January
2000), and the breakup from a woman, this time left standing in the doorway, with the
crushingly laconic remark: &quot;Funny the things you have the hardest time parting with
are the things you need the least.&quot; (Last time, on <i>Time out of Mind</i>, the roles
were reversed&#151;there it goes: &quot;You left me standing in the doorway crying.&quot;;
see my <a href="momentum.htm">The Momentum of Standstill - <em>Time out of Mind </em>and
the blues</a> for a discussion of this song).<sup> </sup>The end is heralded with the
lightly reshaped quote from Virgil: &quot;I&#146;m going to spare the defeated, I&#146;m
going to speak to the crowd / I&#146;m going to teach peace to the conquered, I&#146;m
going to tame the proud&quot; (The qoute is from book 6 in Virgil&#146;s <i>Aeneid</i>,
where Anchises exhorts his son Aeneas about how to rule: </p>

</font>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;Remember, Romans, these will be your arts: / to teach the ways of peace to 
  those you conquer / to spare defeated peoples, tame the proud. (<font FACE="Garamond">VI,851–853; </font>
  from Allen Mandelbaum's translation, Bantam Books (pp. 160-161). </p>
</blockquote>
<font FACE="Garamond">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the final strophe there is again the echo of disaster, and again associated with love:
&quot;The leaves are rustling in the wood, things are falling off the shelf / You&#146;re
gonna need my help, sweetheart, you can&#146;t make love all by yourself.&quot; We
recognize the Help motive from &quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;Highwater&quot;&#151;here
it shows up from yet another perspective.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In &quot;Moonlight&quot;, the connection is more subtle. The refrain is
an innocent invitation to a saunter in the moonlight, but small hints elsewhere in the
text make us suspect that it may not be going to be a romantic stroll: the air is thick
and heavy, twisted trees cast their shadows<sup> </sup>(See note ) and &quot;the earth and
sky &#133; melt with flesh and bone&quot;. Three lines in the middle of the song sound
like a direct comment to &quot;Floater&quot;: &quot;I&#146;m preaching peace and harmony,
the blessings of tranquility, yet I know when the time is right to strike.&quot; Perhaps
should the song be seen in relation to the <i>murder ballad </i>tradition, as, e.g. in the
traditional &quot;Banks of the Ohio&quot;, where the man takes his beloved&#146;s life
during a walk on the riverside? The narrator in &quot;Moonlight&quot; does say:
&quot;I&#146;ll take you &#146;cross the river, dear&quot; (like a Charon across the
Styx?&#151;again a River metaphor), and we are suddenly not sure if the bells call to a a
wedding or a funeral: &quot;For whom does the bell toll for, love? / They toll for you and
me.&quot; [In the Doomsday-laden &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; from <i>Time out of Mind </i>(1997)
we find the line: &quot;I can hear the church-bells ringing in the yard. I wonder who
they&#146;re ringing for.&quot;]</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bells are ringing in &quot;Summer Days&quot; too. These bells are
explicitly wedding bells, but not even here can we be absolutely sure: &quot;What looks
good in the day, at night is another thing.&quot; This ambiguity is implicit already from
the song&#146;s title: &quot;Summer days&quot; foreshadows a light an merry summer song,
which is also supported by the poignant rockabilly arrangement. But what the song really
is about, is autumn: &quot;Summer days <i>are gone</i>&quot;. This song too is constructed
around a series of images and motives that we recognize from other songs: the Help motive
(&quot;She&#146;s lookin&#146; into my eyes and she&#146;s a-holdin&#146; my hand&quot;),
Time (&quot;She says, &quot;You can&#146;t repeat the past,&quot; / I say &quot;You
can&#146;t? What do you mean you can&#146;t? Of course, you can&quot; [This line, one of
Dylan&#146;s most exuberant, is based on a dialogue in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#146;s <i>The
Great Gatsby</i>. See <a href="http://pool.dylantree.com/phorum/read.php?f=2&amp;i=15849&amp;t=15849">http://pool.dylantree.com/phorum/read.php?f=2&amp;i=15849&amp;t=15849</a>
for a lucid discussion of this connection], The River (&quot;standing by God&#146;s river,
my soul&#146;s beginning to shake&quot;), and the breakup&#151;again violent ad
surprising: &quot;I&#146;m leavin&#146; in the morning &#133;, gonna break in the roof,
set fire to the place as a parting gift.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the surface &quot;Cry Awhile&quot; is the most explicitly hostile
song, with the refrain &quot;I cried for you, now it&#146;s your turn, you can cry
awhile&quot;, and the final point &quot;I always said you&#146;d be sorry, and today could
be the day. / I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial&quot; [<i>Your
Funeral My Trial</i> is the title of an album by Nick Cave (1986). Cave has also recorded
an entire album of <i>Murder Ballads</i> (1996), which also included Dylan&#146;s
&quot;Death is not the End&quot;.]. Thus, the song seems to point back to
&quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Floater&quot;, from the perspective of the repenting
sinner: &quot;I&#146;m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can&#146;t
control /&#133; / But I&#146;m crying to the Lord, trying to be meek and mild&quot;.
Thereby it is also, in a twisted way, the most loving song&#151;even though the
perspective entails that it may perhaps be too late.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these songs, then, relate to the same basic motive&#151;a breakup
from a love relation. It is treated in different ways, from different perspectives, but in
the final end, the outcome is always the same. It is as if Dylan wanted to say: no matter
where one starts or how one attempts to solve the problem, it ends in disaster. All roads
lead to Rome (or to Doom)&#151;whether one wants to get there or not.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last song on the album, &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;, is a &#145;Grand
Ballad&#146; of the same cut as the closing songs on several Dylan albums. The song begins
with the large overview, where the narrator stands alone against the rest of the world,
but is in possession of esoteric knowledge, thanks to his alienation: &quot;I got my back
to the sun &#146;cause the light is too intense. / I can see what everybody in the world
is up against.&quot; The recurring theme is again separation&#151;&quot;Sugar Baby get on
down the road, &#133; / you went years without me, might as well keep going
now&quot;&#151;but here the perspective is more distanced than in the earlier songs: sober
and motto-like the state of affairs is presented in cliche-like turns: &quot;Can&#146;t
turn back, you can&#146;t come back, sometimes we push too far&quot;, &quot;Some of these
memories you can learn to live with, and some of them you can&#146;t.&quot; His own
painful experience of the separation is drawn into the same distanced framework of both
understanding and language: &quot;Your charms have broken many a heart, and mine is surely
one.&quot; The deeply personal is mixed with the general, without ever dominating: the
generalization &quot;There ain&#146;t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring&quot;,
leads directly into the next generalization, about love, but with the opposite value:
&quot;Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love&#151;not an evil thing.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The apocalyptic element is there, but only as a shadow, in a cliché
phrase: &quot;You got a way of tearing the world apart, love&quot;, followed by the
album&#146;s only direct reference to the Apocalypse in a Biblical sense: &quot;Look up,
look up, seek you maker &#146;fore Gabriel blows his horn.&quot; [The line is a direct
quotation from Gene Austin&#146;s &quot;The Lonesome Road&quot; from 1927, which has also
contributed with the melody to &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;]. This <i>might</i> be read as if
the circle is closed, that the religious redemption is the solution to love&#146;s
problem, but this would be reading too much into it. Rather, the message&#151;if there is
a message&#151;is that just as unfathomable as religious redemption, just as difficult is
the &#145;redemption&#146; of earthly love. By using the one to describe the other, the
problem is brought to an existential level, where religious themes are relevant, for
comparison or description, but we are not offered any <i>solution</i>. As I pointed out in
the introduction, this is the strength of Dylan&#146;s poetic, and in <i>Love and Theft </i>it
is generally treated with great care and skill.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the survey so far one might get the impression that <i>Love and
Theft </i>is a dark and somber album, and there are certainly plenty of dark strands in
the weave. But an equally salient feature is the exuberant joy of pouring out words: the
lines are filled to the point where they seem to burst, and the songs are mostly long.
They are also filled with humorous flashes, especially puns of the kind that Dylan from
time to time has delivered from stage during his shows: &quot;Call down to room service,
say &#145;send up a room&#146; &quot;, &quot;Politician got on his jogging shoes, he must
be running for office, got no time to lose.&quot; </font><font FACE="Garamond" SIZE="5"></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Music</font><font FACE="Garamond"><i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Love and Theft </i>is not a cycle of poems, it is a record, so a few
words about the music is appropriate. Most striking is the total mix of styles, and
particularly the unabashed use of swing-jazz from the &#145;30s. On several occasion Dylan
has expressed his liking for artists like Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, but he has never
used such a style in his own music. [But he <i>has</i> played covers of this kind of songs
during his concerts, with some consistency since the late &#146;80s]. This may, perhaps
surprisingly, explain the musical freshness that pervades the record: when Dylan relates
to a style that is new to him (in the capacity of listener, not of performer), it calls
for an attentiveness and concentration which is not as compellingly necessary when he
sails in the well-known waters of the blues. The same phenomenon could be observed when
he, with the fervor of the convert, turned his attention to Gospel music in the late 70s.
Add to this that Dylan this time has left more than usual to his musicians, mostly taken
from his very experienced and tight touring band. Especially the two guitarists Charlie
Sexton and Larry Campbell demonstrate a full command of the various styles that Dylan
explores, be it swing or blues. Therefore, Dylan can, for the first time in his carreer,
let his own guitar, one of his trademarks, be as good as absent (and his other trademark:
the harmonica, is not heard at all).</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It needs to be said that the appealing notion of the 60-year-old Dylan
who all of a sudden turns into a 30s&#146; crooner, isn&#146;t entirely truthful. There is
a reason why the record is called <i>&quot;Love and theft&quot;</i>. The title seems to be
a direct comment to its origin: he has not just &#145;stolen&#146; the general style of
music that he loves&#151;at least four of the songs have &#145;borrowed&#146; (read:
stolen) both melodies and the entire arrangements from songs that were actually written in
the 20s and the 30s, performed by Bing Crosby, Billie Holiday and others. This does not
diminish the album&#146;s musical merits, but a note on the album sleeve about the origins
and composers of the songs, would have been welcome; no such thing can be found.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other main group of songs consists of variations of the blues
pattern. Being a performer who has played the blues during an entire 40-year carreer,
there is remarkably little &#145;straight&#146; 12-bar blues in Dylan&#146;s catalogue. He
is a master in varying the simple blues patterns; it seems like a self-imposed constraint
against which he constantly fights. The same can be said about <i>Love and Theft</i>. Ca.
half of the songs fall in this category. This might have created a certain monotony, but
so is in fact not the case. By exploiting large parts of the range of subgenres to which
the blues has developed during its 100-years&#146; history (delta blues, rockabilly,
heavy, electric Chicago blues etc.), and through variations in phrase length and playful
use of little riffs and licks, Dylan and his band manage to keep the listener&#146;s
attention even in songs that otherwise might have felt too long.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one particular feature is to be emphasized, it will have to be
Dylan&#146;s continuous &#145;struggle&#146; against the dominant. In its most common form
the blues pattern is a principally unconcluded, cyclic form, where each round through the
scheme ends with a strong dominant figure (e.g. the &#145;turnaround&#146;) which leads
back to the keynote and the next verse. Dylan, on his part, has always preferred to tone
down this function, either through different &#145;diverting maneouvres&#146;, by
modifying the dominant chord (e.g. by using an 11th chord, which in effect is a
subdominant chord with a dominant bass), or by leaving out the dominant altogether. This
is the case for most of the blues numbers on <i>Love and Theft</i>. Particularly elegant
in this respect is &quot;Cry Awhile&quot;, which is never even close to the dominant, but
precisely through its absence where it is expected the most, makes itself all the more
felt. By treating the dominant in this way the character of chord <i>progressions</i> is
weakened&#151;the different scale steps are instead treated as <i>stations</i>, freed from
the course of time. In a subtle way this accords with the way the course of time is
treated in the lyrics, both in the time-dissolving &quot;Mississippi&quot; (&quot;got no
future, got no past&quot;) and in &quot;Sugar Baby&quot;&#146;s abstract, timeless
catchphrase condition.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One song sticks out from the ones mentioned so far: &quot;Po&#146;
Boy&quot;. It deals with a poor guy who washes the dishes and feed the pigs, pays too much
in the store, has the police on his back and is (probably) made a cuckold by some Freddie,
but who is still basically happy and satisfied. In the middle of the song we also get a
glimpse of a conversation between Othello and Desdemona, about what actually happened with
that poisoned wine. All in all a text that fits Dylan&#146;s own description well, as a
tune that sings itself and a text that doesn&#146;t interfer with the tune [The &quot;Rome
interview&quot; (July 23, 2001): &quot;That song sort of plays itself. &#133; Because,
that&#146;s a song that could exist without any lyric. It exists just on chord structures
&#133; and the lyrics are just trying to stay in the path and not to lay too much
emotional rhetoric here and there.&quot;]. It&#146;s a charming little gem. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;The Voice of a Generation&#146; is getting older, but <i>Love and
Theft </i>proves that he still stands comparison with any of the other generations to
which he has belonged. He can still be poignant and playful like in the 60s, pensive and
bitter as in the 70s, apocalyptic as in the 80s. Age has extended the field of possible
subjects, but this comes in addition to and not instead of earlier periods&#146;
preoccupations. This is a particular kind of novelty: to be able to keep the old when the
new is added. Not many artists master <i>that </i>art form better than Dylan.</font></p>
