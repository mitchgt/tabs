<p>Eric Clapton once said about Dylan<i>:&nbsp;&quot;</i>His way of playing anything is
totally hybrid. It doesn't make sense musically to the scholar. [...] At first listening,
everything he does is just real hopeless. Then you look back and realise it's exactly
right.&quot; As a scholar I take this as a challenge:&nbsp;If something is &quot;exactly
right&quot;, but still doesn't make sense to the scholar, it is either the scholar's sense
or the scholar's analytical tools that are inadequate. I take the liberty of disregarding
the first possibility - although that is probably the commonest cause for scholarly
not-being-made-sense-to-ness - and concentrate on the second:&nbsp;the problems inherent
in musical analysis of music of Dylan's kind.</p>

<h3><a name="art"></a>The Object</h3>

<p>An analysis presupposes an <i>object of analysis</i>, and this is the first problem I
would like to discuss. The practice, or phenomenon, of musical analysis is closely
connected with developments in the genres and styles of music making of the end of the
eighteenth and all of the nineteenth century. This is the so called classical-romantical
period with composers like Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Wagner. This is also the period
when the modern concept of art developed [<i>see my article <a href="../../../prod.htm">Apples
and Pears - the ancient and the modern concepts of art</a></i>], and - towards the end of
the period - even modern musicology. The tools and methods of musical analysis which are
used today, rely heavily on the work of the founders of the discipline, for better or for
worse. They were certainly clever and skilled academics, but their material and
theoretical background was of course limited, and modern musicology has only reluctantly
and most often half-heartedly realized that theories based upon works by Mozart may work
exellently for analysing works by Mozart, but may be worthless for other genres. Popular
music is one of these, but there are even examples from within the &quot;established&quot;
field of musicology:&nbsp;most, or all, early (pre-Bach) music defies analysis with the
traditional methods, in much the same way as a Dylan song does.</p>

<p>A central idea in traditional analysis is the double notion of a unified musical <i>work</i>
with an <i>internal development</i>. The <i>work </i>may be the product of a composer's
free and creative mind, but it is laid down once and for all in the score, and there ends
the liberty. Any realization of the work must be compliant with the score - add a note,
and you have, strictly speaking, a different work. There is really no room for
improvisation, except within very limited boundaries, and even these are usually not
exploited:&nbsp;in the place where the pianist is <i>supposed</i> to improvise an
exuberant cadenza, most performers are content with playing the cadenzas that Mozart
himself, or Beethoven, wrote. This is of course lamentable from the point of view of
musical creativity, but the analyst applauds:&nbsp;it gives him a clearly defined object
of analysis, from the first note to the last.</p>

<p>Contrast this with the situation of a Dylan song:&nbsp;what is the object of analysis
of, say, <i>The times they are a-changin'</i>? The published &quot;score&quot;, usually
with remarkably silly piano arrangements of Dylan's guitar strumming? The album version,
tabbed and downloaded to <a href="http://music.lsds.com/guitar/d/bob_dylan/">OLGA</a>?
Clearly both alternatives are inadequate, to say the least. My first encounter with
&quot;Forever Young&quot; was of this kind. I saw it in a song book before I had heard it.
I looked through the melody, the chords, tried to imagine how it might sound - and
rejected it as a fairly uninteresting post-motor-cycle-accident,
pre-&quot;Blood-on-the-tracks&quot;-song. When I later, almost reluctantly, bought the
album, this song was a shock of emotional intensity, in this case even reinforced by the
tension between the two versions. And you can probably take any Dylan song the same way:
It doesn't look much on the paper - whatever power there is, lies somewhere else. </p>

<p>This is one reason why a transcription in any form cannot do the song, as a musical
work, justice. The other is, of course, that no matter how meticulously you note every
single detail of one particular performance, the next time you hear it, it will be
different, either because Dylan has rearranged the song, or simply because of the
improvisational character of popular music in general, and Dylan's music making in
particular. With an object of analysis which cannot be objectified, since it changes all
the time, there is really no other alternative than to endorse Paul Williams' approach: to
treat every single performance of a song as an independent work of art. The performance is
the object.</p>

<p>We might have settled with this, but upon closer look, it is still too simple an
explanation. I used to be attracted to Jeff Todd Titon's approach to the improvisational
character of blues [in his book &quot;Early Downhome Blues&quot;]. He assumes that most of
the early blues songs were improvised on the spot, that words and music were assembled
while singing, from the singer's storehouse of phrases, situations, turns, descriptions,
according to some specific pattern, but without a fixed text that is repeated exactly from
performance to performance. Even when singing the &quot;same&quot; song several times in a
row, it is improvised from scratch each time, and minor (and even major) differences occur
between the versions (he actually tested this). I used to think of Dylan's performances in
the same way, given the huge mass of text and the re-workings of some of the texts, until
I realized that the variations are too small to really fit the model. The texts are
actually memorized in a next to exact form, and the different versions of a song like
Tangled up in Blue are conscious re-writings, not improvisations. </p>

<p>Now, the same goes for the music. This may seem odd since&nbsp;one of the most
distinctive traits of Dylan as an artist is his way of constantly changing the musical
setting of his songs. The melody is probably the most unstable element, but even the
tempo, the rhythm, the instrumentation change all the time. But still:&nbsp;the songs are
always recognizeable as such. Usually the chords and harmonies are intact, and variations
are within the normal limits of the genre. However different two performances of Just Like
a Woman may be, they are versions of the same song all the same, and not only two
different works of art which happen to have the same words attached to them. There is
always something that is preserved, through all the variations. </p>

<p>This simple observation opens up a large field of interesting questions concerning
Dylan's relation to the different styles that have influenced him (blues, english folk
ballads, The Beatles and rock 'n' roll) on the one hand, and to the different genres of
music production (the orally transmitted folk/blues, the performed, score-based classical
music and the commercial popular music, transmitted through electronic media). To make
this long story short:&nbsp;Dylan relates strongly to improvisational musical traditions,
but also to traditions with an ultimately defined &quot;work&quot;:&nbsp;defined either by
what the composer has decreed as in classical music, or by what is considered commercially
most efficient. </p>

<p>In this sense, Dylan's songs are <i>not</i> improvisational once they have reached an
album [it seems however that the creational process involves a substantial element of
improvisation], he seldom deviates strongly from, and always relate closely to the
&quot;official&quot; versions. This means that although each performance may be considered
an independent &quot;work of art&quot;, it is still meaningful to treat the group of works
that can be subsumed under the label &quot;Just like a woman&quot; as one single work of
art with many realizations, much in the same way as 50 prints from the same plates are
individual works but at the same time representations of the same work.</p>

<p>Paul Williams has himself hinted at a view similar to this. In the introduction to his
books &quot;Bob Dylan:&nbsp;Performing Artist&quot; he relates an anecdote about a
backstage meeting with Dylan. He was going to make a comparison between the different
Dylan versions and a series of lithographs by Picasso, worked on over the course of six
weeks. He writes: 

<ul>
  <li><i>&quot;At first Dylan protested that he wasn't interested in that kind of art at all,
    but he looked at the page and seemed to be pulled in. Staying with his initial (it seemed
    to me)&nbsp;anti-intellectual stance, he pointed to the second earliest of the drawings
    and proclaimed it as the best:&nbsp;&quot;He should have stopped at that
    one.&quot;&nbsp;Then, looking closer:&nbsp;&quot;Oh, but I see why he had to keep
    going...&quot;</i></li>
</ul>

<p>But the problems still remains: what is it about a performance that makes it worthy of
the label &quot;work of art&quot;?&nbsp;What are the criteria, and are they the same for
Dylan as for, say, Pavarotti or U2?Are &quot;works of art&quot; from different media or
styles comparable at all?&nbsp;This discussion presupposes another discussion:&nbsp;that
about what a work of art is in the first place. One possible definition may
be:&nbsp;&quot;Somehow a work of art could be described as a structure made up of elements
that are considered apt for reflection or contemplation, and in a way that stimulates
this. That seems to be what we do with art: we enter a different state (of mind or place)
to expose ourselves to something that we allow to influence us, emotionally or
intellectually.&quot; [<i>The definition is taken from my aforementioned <a href="../../../prod.htm#art">article on aesthetics</a>, and I refer to that article for a
further discussion of this</i>] That implies several things:&nbsp;the &quot;structures apt
for reflection&quot; are not objectively given, but open to interpretation on different
cultural or historical contexts - in other words:&nbsp;they are dependent upon <i>style</i>.
A work of art can only be efficient in some kind of relation - including the revolutionary
- to a style [<i>the entirely revolutionary art, without any precedents, although
thoretically interesting, is rare enough to be disregarded</i>]. In periodes of stylistic
change this relation tends to be explicit, whereas in most cases it is implicit. In
Dylan's case there are a number of such implicit styles involved:&nbsp;the
blues-background, the folk, the standard rules of european/american harmony, the
development of rock, traditions of voice treatment and the relationship with the text,
etc. To be able to appreciate a performance fully, as a work of art, it is in fact
necessary for the listener to relate it to the stylistic systems he/she finds relevant, on
all different levels, from the individual style (Dylan's own style), through genre style
(rock/blues/folk in general), and maybe even to some kind of &quot;meta-style&quot; of
song in general. Seen this way, every performance can be seen as a contribution to an
ever-ongoing debate - what can be done within this genre? where are the limits?&nbsp;which
crossovers are possible or artistically interesting? </p>

<p>This brings us back to the definition given above, and the second implication that can
be derived from it: that art-status presupposes a volontary act by the listener, both by
allowing it to influence us, and regarding the stylistical references we make, whether
these are explicitly volontary (I choose to regard Dylan as a blues singer even when he
sings <i>Emotionally Yours</i>, because I find it rewarding), or unconscious (I don't
consciously realize it, but my appreciation of a Dylan song must derive from a whole lot
of different things I've heard and appreciated before), or for lack of knowledge (I don't
know enough about the folk movement to really be able to understand that relation).</p>

<p>Most of this happens unconsciuosly - we don't ponder a performance and then decide to
let it hit us in the stomach with a feeling that changes our life. Rather the choices have
been made in beforehand, we choose to like a certain kind of &quot;screaming&quot; or
whining when it seems that it can be rewarding. I seriously doubt that 18th century
wiennese, however sophisticated and developed their taste may have been, would have
understood anything of any Dylan song. Even (half) the audience at Newport in 1965 and
during the following tour with the Band chose not to be moved or touched by performances
that are now classical precisely because of their emotionality.</p>

<h3><a name="Harmony"></a>The harmony</h3>

<p>The other problem with the concept of the <i>work</i> is its inherent idea of <i>organicism</i>.
A work of art is, very simply stated, to be judged as an organism, where all the parts are
related to eachother in much the same way as the limbs of the body. This is one of the
basic aesthetical principles behind classical music. Even harmony is arranged in a similar
manner:&nbsp;all the available chords are related to the tonic, the fundamental harmony of
the piece, in a coherent and logical way, which even restricts the transition from one
chord to another.</p>

<p>This system found its way from classical music into the realm of popular music through
the hymns and the popular tunes of the Stephen Foster-type, and the military marching
bands. They even managed to influence the field-hollers and laments of black Missisippi
workers to eventually produce the 12-bar blues, and from here it spread to today's popular
music genres. But in these new settings most of the underlying aesthetic presuppositions
of the Western classical harmonic system were not present. The aesthetics behind the rural
blues is almost the exact opposite: instead of striving for a coherent organical whole
with beginning, middle and end, it rather emphasises timelessness, through ostinato
patterns (the 12-bar blues pattern itself can be considered one) and through the
predominance of the tonic and the fifth. Mellers (1984:116) describes two songs of Pete
Williams, an early blues singer, as &quot;still basically hollers in which speech is
translated into pentatonic tumbling strains, with the guitar providing an ostinato
accompainment with no sense of harmonic progression.&quot; Harmonic progression, which is
so essential to western music, has virtually no place at all in blues music, and the
dominant chord, the means <i>par exellence</i> by which harmonic progression is achieved,
is also a foreign flower in the landscape of the blues. It is remarkable how the dominant
chord often sounds awkward - if it is clearly sounded at all - in much rural blues, mainly
due to the sharp contrast between the blues' flat pentatonic seventh, and the sharp
leading note of the dominant chord.</p>

<p>The general development of this genre/style will not be discussed here. I will instead
focus on one aspect of it that is of some relevance for the music making of
Dylan:&nbsp;the interplay between instrument and chords.</p>
