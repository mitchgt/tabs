<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i>Blood on the Tracks </i>is perhaps the most personal album ever
written, and certainly one where the relationship between art and artist cannot be
ignored. The Tangling and Twisting in the first two songs set the tone for the mixed-up
poignancy and regret that permeates the entire record, but <i>Idiot Wind </i>supplies the
side of the divorcee seldom dealt with seriously by popular musicians. The normal break-up
song either has the singer weeping with heart-wrenching (and usually stomach-churning)
sadness or sassily saying &quot;Now go, walk out the door, just turn around now, 'cos your
not welcome anymore&quot;. <i>Idiot Wind, </i>however, is neither pathetic nor facetious -
it is the song of a man seriously confronting himself and unearthing the anger, just as <i>Don't
Think Twice, It's alright </i>found &quot;I&quot; discovering the strength within him to
move on. The narrator in this song is for the most part curiously enraged, and
Dylan&#146;s charred and soaring vocals evoke the howling of a man into the teeth of a
gale, just as Shakespeare&#146;s Lear on the blasted heath roared his angry lament. In <i>The
Freewheelin&#146; </i>cover-notes, Dylan says of <i>Masters of War </i>&#145;I don&#146;t
sing songs which hope people will die&#133;&#146;; the &quot;I&quot; of this song tells us
&quot;One day you&#146;ll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes&#133;&quot; But
then <i>Idiot Wind</i> is as tangled a web as any song that this poet has ever woven.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;stories in the press&quot; are reminiscent of the beginning
of <i>Shelter from the Storm - </i>the narrator reminds us that he had a life before
meeting &quot;you&quot; in which he was &quot;buried in the hail / Poisoned in the bushes,
blown out on the trail&quot;<i>. </i>Whoever has &quot;got it in&quot; for him (at this
time there were any number of journalists/ex-fans etc. &#150; Weberman where are you now?
&#150; getting on Dylan&#146;s case after his disastrous start to the 70s, of course),
this is merely manifesting outwardly what &quot;I&quot; feels inwardly; &quot;everything&#146;s
a little upside down&#133;what&#146;s good is bad, what&#146;s bad is good&quot; &#150;
this backwards reality present to the mind of &quot;I&quot; is now being realised in the
physical world, as &quot;images and distorted facts&quot; dog &quot;I&quot;&#146;s
footsteps. The topsy-turvy nature of a break-up is a key feature of this song. &quot;You
cover up the truth with lies&quot;, &quot;I&#146;ve been double-crossed now for the very
last time&quot;, &quot;It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us
apart&quot; &#150; of these reversals of the usual, the last is the most special,
including the wonderful pun on gravity (that hearkens back to the &#145;gravity
failing&#146; in <i>Just like Tom Thumb&#146;s Blues</i>)<i>. </i>It was grave and serious
things that got in the couple&#146;s way, but in the same way it was as if a natural
force, as natural as gravity, meant they were never meant to last. This backwards sense is
of course concurrent with the mood of the song; for three verses and choruses the narrator
lambastes &quot;you&quot; in <i>Ballad in Plain D </i>style &#150; this is not the way a
broken-hearted man should act, nor is it the way &quot;I&quot; acts in <i>If you see her,
say hello, </i>or <i>You&#146;re a big girl now. </i>I suppose this is where Dylan
surpasses other songwriters; his honesty rescues him from the tacky pits of self-pity and
he admits that anger is a big part of anguish.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is &quot;I&quot; Dylan? Given his situation at the time, the answer is
probably &#145;in spirit&#146;. I interpret the lines </font><font size="2"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
  building burned <br>
  I waited for you on the running boards near the cypress tree while the springtime turned <br>
  slowly into autumn</font><font SIZE="3"></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">as saying that he has waited in vain for a marriage, which does not
correlate to Dylan&#146;s situation, but the status of &quot;I&quot; is more or less
ambiguous. In another version, Dylan says that he noticed at the ceremony </p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="2">&#133;that you'd left all your bags behind <br>
  the driver came in after you left, he gave them to me, and then he resigned</font><font
  SIZE="3"></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><i> - </i>a wonderful image translating as: You left the ceremony
(maybe the wedding), but you left a piece of yourself inside me, and now your driving
force and lust for life is gone. The &quot;cypress tree&quot; is a widely used symbol of
immortality (and death/afterlife) so perhaps &quot;I&quot; has married but the two have
never achieved that union in time when &quot;Our Eyes, our ears our taste, smell, touch do
like our souls in one combine&quot;, as William Cartwright put it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Either way, one thing is clear: the couple are now beyond any type of
redemption &#150; the death images see to that. &quot;The priest wore black&quot;, &quot;The
flowers on your tomb&quot; <i>&#150; </i>metaphorically these mark the death of
&quot;you&quot;, or at least the death of the part of her that he will ever know. The
memories of her are still with &quot;I&quot;, in the form of the </font>&quot;<font
SIZE="3">chestnut mare</font>&quot; <font SIZE="3">(possibly a reference to the <i>Byrds</i>
song, which paid testament to a &#145;wild horse&#146; who was almost caught, but
eventually got away &#150; the horse being a very old (we're talking medieval here) way of
metaphorically describing lust) and the memories of her &quot;raging glory&quot;, but they
seem to torment &quot;I&quot; as much as inspire regret. The &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; itself
is partly his memory of her voice that blows as she moves her mouth, but also represents
the anger that &quot;I&quot; feels about the natural world that has so damaged him. Allen
Ginsberg saw the &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; as a &quot;disillusioned national rhyme&quot;. I
would go further to say that it is the natural foolishness of life. &quot;ldiot Wind,
blowing like a circle around my skull, / From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol&quot;
&#150; in wooing &quot;you&quot;, &quot;I&quot; feels that he has only followed what the
natural world (or, put another way, destiny) has forced him to do, as if everything from
the tiny industrial town where electricity is made (Coulee Dam a town supposedly housing
the service employees for the Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River, Washington) all the
way to the Capitol where the weight of nations rests has made him believe that love will
last forever. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selfishness of &quot;I&quot; is perhaps the most striking aspect of
this song. I said earlier that Dylan manages to avoid self-pity; by the first section of
the fourth verse, we can see &quot;I&quot; practically wallowing in it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="left"><font size="2">You didn&#146;t know it, you didn&#146;t think it could be
  done<br>
  with the final shot he won the war after losing every battle</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> &#150; he both criticises her lack of insight and declares his own
triumph in one fell swoop. In another version, &quot;I&quot; figures &quot;I'd lost you
anyway, why go on? What's the use?&quot;, but unlike, say, Pyramus and Thisbe, this
narrator is not so disillusioned and shattered that he won't tell the story of his woes
over and over. The narrator takes the Doestoyevskian line that because his feelings are so
important, he is above reproach, and therefore when he makes a stand and rejects her, it
is a triumphant and life-affirming act. The criticisms of &quot;you&quot; are generally
ones of appearance &#150; &quot;your eyes don&#146;t look into mine&quot;, &quot;your
corrupt ways have finally made you blind&quot; and finally &quot;I can&#146;t feel you any
more, I can&#146;t even touch the books you&#146;ve read&quot; &#150; the physical world
is confirming his suspicions; she is shallow and easily lost contact with (perhaps the
line from <em>Lonesome Day Blues </em>is relevant &#150; &quot;Funny how things you have
the hardest time parting with / are the things you need the least&quot;). When he kisses
goodbye the howling beast, there is a sense of flippancy and arrogance that undercuts the
obvious sorrow and anger.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But&#133;how often is there a &#145;but&#146; in Dylan songs?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the final two lines of the final verse spell a tender change along
the line of <em>Boots of Spanish Leather </em>with the &quot;Yes, there is something you
can send back to me&#133;&quot;, where we are unsure whether to side with &quot;I&quot;,
&quot;her&quot;, neither or both. Dylan does not emphasise this with the singing (at least
not on the album version; I have never heard him sing it live), but the poignancy of the
conclusion comes through anyway. &quot;You&#146;ll never know the hurt I&#146;ve suffered,
nor the pain I rise above&quot; &#150; the pinnacle of his self-pity &#150; and then BOOM!
Or rather </font><font SIZE="1">whimper</font>:<font SIZE="3"> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">But then I&#146;ll never know the same about you, your
  holiness or your kind of love, <br>
  and it makes me feel so sorry.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This turnaround is one of those finishes that force you to view the
preceding lines in a new light. Suddenly the spotlight is inward, admitting that he failed
to try hard enough, and that whatever trials they went through and whoever&#146;s fault it
was, they did just that &#150; they went through it. The song becomes less a divorce song
and more that of a Robert Johnson hell song &#150; &quot;I&#146;m gonna beat my woman
&#145;til I get satisfied&quot; from <em>Me and the Devil</em>:<em> </em> it sounds
brutal, but it casts a light on the singer that means we have pity for him as well. We
have to reconsider the &quot;after all these years, you didn&#146;t know me any better
than that&quot; &#150; if it has been so long, hasn&#146;t he realised yet that she
doesn&#146;t know him at all? Does he know her so badly? Perhaps he had been to see the
nay-saying soothsayer (or had thrown the I-Ching &#150; many of Dylan's songs could be
described as akin to the I-Ching in terms of difficulty and obscurity) before, and she
told him <em>then </em>to &quot;beware of lightning that might strike&quot;, implying that
he has conducted himself throughout the whole of their affair expecting it to fail.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last chorus should be muted and subdued as the joint pronouns kick
in. Dylan&#146;s singing walks the perilous tightrope between expressiveness and cacophony
but succeeds in becoming the former (unlike, say, <em>John Wesley Harding</em>) for the
most part, but a softer ending, perhaps ceasing the organ for the chorus which sounds so
windswept and atmospheric earlier on, would have been more lucid. The flowers on her grave
have become &quot;our coats&quot;, &quot;our shelves&quot; and the &quot;Idiot Wind&quot;
is now as much a part of him as of her. I particularly like the &quot;letters that we
wrote&quot; &#150; metaphorically these letters are the chronicles of their time together
since they were written not by &quot;I&quot; or &quot;you&quot; alone, but as a
partnership, one to write and one to read, and even though he has kissed goodbye that
howling beast, he still keeps them on the shelves that he cannot prevent being &quot;our
shelves&quot;. Ezekiel preached to the wind and it brought life to the dry bones; the
Greeks believed that the North Wind could fertilise horses; perhaps &quot;I&quot; realises
that however the Idiot Wind hurt him, it brought life to him because it showed him for a
moment the holiness and the kind of love that maketh man. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the great work of art and of craft that Dylan presents with
Idiot Wind. The inwardly-devoted man griping about how his wife/girlfriend betrayed him
and happy to see her thrown down is set up so as to be knocked down when the truth finally
dawns on him. The song itself is a masterpiece of timing and lyrical dexterity, it swells
ominously as time passes and the slightly miffed narrator who reads unpleasant stories in
the press and is upset by his wife&#146;s mild question becomes a howlin&#146; wolf,
wishing that his life had never happened, staggering down the tracks, perhaps following
her to the ecstasy that might come when he dies and his soul is put to rest, but then the
big wild climax is neatly cut off with the scissors of understanding. By leaving the
realisation to the very end of the song, Dylan imbues the suffering that &quot;I&quot;
tells us of with a certain redemptiveness; he has wronged and been wronged, he suffers for
it, ultimately his suffering leads to redemption and understanding tempered with regret.
This is, I feel, where this song sticks out from many of Dylan&#146;s other marvellous
creations; this is a cyclic song, without the intriguing loose ends of <i>Trying to Get to
Heaven </i>or <i>I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine </i>but a more tightly bound work that
throws as much light on the writer, or at least the narrator, as any other.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"> *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not by any means a full analysis of this song (we can&#146;t
all be musicologists [<em>Editor's remark</em>: that's not a guarantee of fullness of
analysis]) and there may well be references, allusions/illusions/elusions that I have
overlooked. I am sure there is something behind the &quot;man named Grey&quot; other than
his murky and blurred black/white name, and the <i>howling beast</i> is oddly pertinent (a
Cerberus-like guard, implying that she has descended into Hades, while he has escaped (or
vice versa)? A defence? A warning?). </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would appreciate any feedback or opinions. But whatever idiot&#146;s
wind this writing might be, I hope it illuminates some of what I feel about this majestic
song.</p>
