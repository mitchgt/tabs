<p></font><font face="Garamond"><a name="[1]">[1]</a> At one of the late summer shows this
year (in 2002), there was suddenly another text: some highfalutin summary of his carreer
(&quot;The poet laureate of rock 'n' roll. The voice of the promise of the '60s
counterculture. The guy who forced folk into bed with rock, who donned makeup in the '70s
and disappeared into a haze of substance abuse, who emerged to &quot;find Jesus,' who was
written off as a has-been by the end of the '80s, and who suddenly shifted gears and
released some of the strongest music of his career beginning in the mid-'90s.&quot; ). The
indefatigable Dylan-Influence Search Squad quickly found this to be an exact quote from a
newspaper article about yesterday&#146;s concert. Since the same article called <i>Under
the Red Sky</i> (1990) one of Dylan&#146;s weakest albums, and Dylan played the title song
from this album, which hasn&#146;t been performed regularly since the mid-90s, at the same
concert, it it difficult not to see it as a wry comment of some sort, on Dylan&#146;s
part. The new &quot;invitatorium&quot; stuck, however, and interspersed as it is with
elements from the old introduction, it almost resembles the tropes of Medieval liturgy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><a name="[1b">[1b</a>] To paraphrase C. Geertz; Geertz' original
expression: &quot;In a ritual, the world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under
the agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turn out to be the same world&quot; (<em>The
Interpretation of Cultures,</em> New York 1973, p. 112) is more problematic, owing to the
too simple distinction between life and imagination, and the ascription of the meaning of
ritual to something as evasive and abstract (in the literal sense of something removed
from experience) as &quot;symbolic forms&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond"><a name="[2]">[2]</a> This brings to mind the scene from <i>Life
of Brian</i> where Brian speaks to the crowd that takes him for Messiah: &quot;You are all
individuals,&quot; and they answer, as if with one mouth: &quot;We are all
individuals&quot;.</font></p>
