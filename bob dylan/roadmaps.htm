<h2><a name="General">General principles</a></h2>

<p>Just a few words about the principles that (mostly) have been followed in making the
tabs on this site. </p>

<p>First of all: this is a guitar site, not a &quot;chord&quot; site. The ideal
&quot;readers&quot; I have in mind are the average (or average-to-good-to-very-good)
guitar players, playing for their own enjoyment (let's not talk about the neighbours -
just love them). That means on the one hand that I transcribe the songs into what is
convenient to play on a guitar, not necessarily into what is actually sounding--in other
words: I use the capo, just like Bob Dylan himself. Just because a song happens to be
played in the key of Eb major, doesn't mean that it has to be tabbed in that key, when it
is actually played in &quot;C major&quot; with a capo on the third fret. </p>

<p>2. A corollary of this is that my aim is not just giving the chords of a song, but also
to figure out as exactly as possible what is being played in the version up for study.</p>

<p>3. On the other hand there is the problem of the &quot;piano songs&quot; and the
&quot;full band songs&quot;. Whereas Dylan prefers (or preferred; things have changed) the
keys of C major and G major on the guitar, he delights in odd, awkward keys with lots of
black keys, especially C# major (or Db major), when he's at the piano. In these cases it
is of course impossible to reproduce exactly what is being played. I still use a capo (of
course). In the &quot;full band songs&quot; - especially in later years - Dylan usually
just plays the chords, in any position, usually with barre chords somewhere up on the
neck.</p>

<p>This means that there are three main types of tabs/chord-files on this site,
corresponding with three kinds of arrangements: (1) The solo acoustic songs, or songs
where the guitar work is of some prominence. Here exactness is a goal. (2) Then there is
the big group of songs where no particular instrument is prominent, least of all Dylan's
guitar. Here the aim of the tabs is to present an approximation of what is going on in the
song, rather than figuring out exactly what Dylan is playing (which in these cases is
quite uninteresting, actually). (3) The piano songs constitute a sub-division of this
group.</p>

<p>Many of the tabs are of rare live songs. I presume that anyone who would want to use
the tabs already knows what the songs sound like. Therefore, more specific performance
indications, apart from the fingerings, are considered unnecessary.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a NAME="Chords"></a><b>Chords and Chord Names</b></h2>

<p><b>For beginners (ain't we all...).<strong> </strong></b>The tabs present what is being
played, by trained and proficient musicians (yes, I'm counting in Dylan). On the one hand
Dylan is an ideal artist for a beginner, since he always uses quite simple and logical
chord shapes, and licks and tricks that let him get maximum effect from minimum effort.
Still, the beginner may run into problems, with strange chord names, barré chords etc.
Here's just a few cheats. <br>
(1) All chords, basically, go back to the three fundamental chords in a key (in C: C, G
and F) and their minor relatives (Am, Em, Dm). Most frequent are the variations to the
dominant chord, i.e. the chord on the fifth step above the key note (G in this example),
where the variations are different ways of creating and sustaining tension before the
return to the key note. That means that &quot;strange&quot; chord names can often be
replaced by the simple chord without all the fuzz behind it (Gb+, E7-10, Dm7-5, Cadd9
become Gb, E, Dm, C). This does not happen without loss: the &quot;fuzz&quot; is there for
some reason (e.g. the E7-10 is the quintessential blues chord, which is minor and major at
the same time; it is an E chord, but the plain E does not get the same effect), but
functionally the plain chord will usually do the job adequately. <br>
(2) Chords can be replaced with their relatives. When I was 9, before I had the strength
to play barré chords, I discovered that I could replace most F chords with Dm or Am - one
of those would usually work. Now I know that the reason why it works, is that they both
share two out of three chord tones with F, which often is enough. I don't recommend this
method, however (unless you're 9). It is cheatin', and the only person you're fooling, in
the long run, is yourself. <br>
(3) Some songs are consistently noted with chords like Ab, Eb, Bb etc. That is because
they are played with those chords, as barre chords, and in those cases I've seen no reason
to introduce a capo. The easiest way to avoid those barre chords, is to drop all the bs,
and play E, B, A instead. This only works if all chords have a b attached to them, though.
Other chords you'll have to transpose based on the thorough knowledge of the outline of
the fretboard that you've gained, e.g. from the figure below. </p>

<p><strong>Chord short-hand.</strong> I usually present the chords used in the song,
unless it should be obvious (someone who doesn't know how to play a C major chord probably
doesn't have anything to do in here anyway...). Chords are presented with one number for
each string, beginning with the lowest (6th) string. An open string is 0, a finger on the
3rd fret is 3 etc. An unused string is marked by 'x', and strings that are disregarded are
marked '-'. Thus C major looks like this: x32010, and the recurring fill in &quot;Blood in
my Eyes&quot; like this: x32010&nbsp; -53---&nbsp; -64---&nbsp; -75---. <br>
NOTE: I prefer to write the chords with the key note as the lowest bass note in the chord.
Thus, even though C major can be played 032010 or 332010 (and often should be), either of
the tones on the 6th string will disturb the &quot;C-majority&quot; of the chord, and is
better left out, unless they are explicitly wanted, e.g. in a running bass progression.</p>

<p><strong>Bass notes.</strong> A chord with a bass note other than the keynote is
indicated with a slash between the chord name and the bass note: C/g is a C major chord
with G as the lowest tone: 332010. <br>
The slash and the bass note can be used alone to indicate a bass progression against a
sustained chord: C&nbsp; /b&nbsp; /a&nbsp; /g. <br>
I usually use lower-case letters for these bass tones, because it looks less ugly.</p>

<p><strong>Chord names.</strong> In general I use the following system (exemplified with C
chords throughout): Major chords C: Minor chords: Cm. The following table explains the
additional symbols and chord types. All the examples are variants of C. Third = the third
note of the scale from the key note, fifth = the fifth note of the scale, etc. Since there
are only seven different steps in the scale, the second is the same as the ninth, the
fourth is the same as the eleventh etc. In chord names one will usually use the higher of
these, except where the basic triad is altered;&nbsp; e.g. C9 and not C2 (but Csus4 and
Cm7-5). The reason for this is that &quot;sophisticated&quot; chords are considered as
extensions of the basic chord with selections from the stack of thirds above it: c-e-g
continues Bb-d-f-a, which are the 7th, the 9th, the 11th and the 13th. The convention is
that a single number (e.g. 11) indicates the <em>last member</em> of the stack to be
included, not just a single tone: C11 consists of the all the tones in the stack, up to
the eleventh.</p>

<p>I usually also prefer simple names to &quot;exact&quot; names. A chord like 3x3211
should perhaps (but not necessarily) be called G11, but I prefer to call it F/g, since
that more immediately says what is to be played (and because it retains the ambiguity
inherent in the chord, between the subdominant and the dominant, which is so central to
Dylan's tonal language). See <a HREF="36_wgw/blood_in_my_eyes.html">Blood in my Eyes</a>
for a more extreme case. (I'm beginning to change my mind on this, though. In the more
recent tabs, you'll see G11 more often than F/g).</p>

<p>Approximated chord names are written like &quot;G6&quot; (x33000) or F#m7' (202200) for
brevity. </p>

<p>Any chord can be fingered in many different ways. &quot;C&quot; does not
&quot;mean&quot; x32010 - that is just the simplest and usually most convenient way to
finger it. To get from&nbsp; chord name to a chord, you have to know where the tones are
positioned on the fretboard. The tones are distributed on the strings as follows (e' is
the lightest string, E is the darkest): </p>

<p><tt>e'||-f'-|-f#'|-g'-|-g#'|-a'|-</tt> <br>
<tt>b ||-c'-|-c#'|-d'-|-d#'|-e'|-</tt> <br>
<tt>g ||-g#-|-a--|-bb-|-b--|-c'|-</tt>&nbsp; etc.<br>
<tt>d ||-d#-|-e--|-f--|-f#-|-g-|-</tt> <br>
<tt>A ||-Bb-|-B--|-c--|-c#-|-d-|-</tt> <br>
<tt>E ||-F--|-F#-|-G--|-G#-|-A-|-</tt> </p>

<p>To find a chord like Am/f# (the most important chord in&nbsp; <a href="38_toom/trying_to_get_to_heaven.htm">Trying to Get to Heaven</a>), start with the
basic chord (Am) and search out the bass tone (f#) on one of the darkest strings, where it
can be played. In this case there are two possibilities: on the 4th string: <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<tt>e'||-f'-|-f#'|-g'-|-g#'|-a'|</tt> <br>
<tt>b ||-<font COLOR="#FF0000">c'</font>-|-c#'|-d'-|-d#'|-e'|</tt> <br>
<tt>g ||-g#-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">a</font>--|-bb-|-b--|-c'|</tt> <br>
<tt>d ||-d#-|<font COLOR="#FF6666">(e)</font>-|-f--|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">f#</font>-|-g-|</tt>
<br>
<tt>A ||-Bb-|-B--|-c--|-c#-|-d-|</tt> <br>
<tt>E ||-F--|-F#-|-G--|-G#-|-A-|</tt> </p>

<p>or on the 6th: </p>

<p><tt>e'||-f'-|-f#'|-g'-|-g#'|-a'|</tt> <br>
<tt>b ||-<font COLOR="#FF0000">c'</font>-|-c#'|-d'-|-d#'|-e'|</tt> <br>
<tt>g ||-g#-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">a</font>--|-bb-|-b--|-c'|</tt> <br>
<tt>d ||-d#-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">e</font><font COLOR="#000000">-</font>-|-f--|-<font COLOR="#000000">f#</font>-|-g-|</tt> <br>
<tt>A ||-Bb-|-B--|-c--|-c#-|-d-|</tt> <br>
<tt>E ||-F--|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">F#</font>-|-G--|-G#-|-A-|</tt> </p>

<p>The second fingering is probably the best one, since it produces a fuller chord, and
since you can use all the strings - unless you precisely want the higher sound, in which
case the first fingering is better. In that case xx4555 is a third alternative. It even
has the advantage of having the key note (A) on the highest string, thus emphasising it. </p>

<p>In the same way we can find the fingering for the chord Bm7-5. First find the tones: Bm
= b, d, f#. Add the 7th (a) and lower the 5th (f# -&gt; f), and we have the tones b, d, f
and a.</p>

<p><tt>e'||-<font COLOR="#FF0000">f'</font>-|-f#'|-g'-|-g#'|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">a'</font>|-</tt>
<br>
<tt><font COLOR="#FF0000">b</font> ||-c'-|-c#'|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">d'</font>-|-d#'|-e'|-</tt>
<br>
<tt>g ||-g#-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">a</font>--|-bb-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">b</font>--|-c'|-</tt>
&nbsp; etc.<br>
<tt><font COLOR="#FF0000">d</font> ||-d#-|-e--|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">f</font>--|-f#-|-g-|-</tt>
<br>
<tt>A ||-Bb-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">B</font>--|-c--|-c#-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">d</font>-|-</tt>
<br>
<tt>E ||-<font COLOR="#FF0000">F</font>--|-F#-|-G--|-G#-|-<font COLOR="#FF0000">A</font>-|-</tt>
</p>

<p>We probably want the key note (b) in the bass, which in practice leaves us with the
alternatives x2323x, xx(3)435 or x2x231. (Note: Am/f# and Bm7-5 are actually chords of the
same type. Am/f# is the same chord as F#m7-5. Try it!) </p>

<h2>Rreading <a name="Tabgraphics">Tab</a></h2>

<p>The principles I've followed in the tabs have varied a little over the years, but the
following points apply, as a rule, to all files:</p>

<p>The rhythm is indicated above the tab, with dots for each beat and : for the heavier
beats:</p>

<pre>   :   .   .   .   :   .   .   .   </pre>

<p>In the cases where an even finer subdivision is needed, a comma is used:</p>

<pre>   :  .  ,  .  ,  .  ,  .  </pre>

<p>As far as possible I let the tabs be a graphical image of the rhythms, so that two
spaces are of equal duration anywhere in the tab. That way one can easily differentiate
between the triple time feel of this example </p>

<pre>  :     .     .     .

<p>Repeats are indicated as in the previous example, or written out (&quot;x3&quot;)</p>

<p>Sometimes I've indicated rhythms also in the &quot;chords&quot; part of the files. Then
the bars are indicated, and the main pulse within each bar. I'm sorry to say that I
haven't followed any consistent system to denote subdivisions of the beat, but I've often
joined such chords together with a hyphen:</p>

<h2><a NAME="opentunings"></a>Open/alternate tunings</h2>

<p>For some of the songs, Dylan uses alternate or open tunings. An open tuning is a tuning
where all the strings are tuned to a chord, whereas alternate tunings are other ways of
altering the tuning. </p>

<p><strong>Open tunings</strong></p>

<p>There were tuned instruments before the guitar's ancestors. They were usually tuned in
open fifths, usually with drone strings and one or two melody strings. The baroque lute
was tuned as an open d minor chord (with additional bass strings). The main advantage of
the fourths/third tuning that we use, is the possibility of creating simple fingering
patterns for <em>many different </em>chords in the same position.<br>
An obvious consequence of open tunings is that playing is more limited to the key to which
the open strings are tuned. The benefits are quite simple chord shapes, at least for the
basic chords, which makes it easier to do fancy things on top of those chords;
furthermore, unless one produces the other chords by simply putting a barre across all the
strings, there will usually be open, sounding strings in all chords, thus giving a handy
set of fancy-chords-with-very-long-names. <br>
The most common open tunings (and the only ones encountered in Dylan's production) are
open D, open E and open G. </p>

<p><strong>Open D and E</strong> are basically the same tuning, only one tone apart. Open
E gives a brighter sound, which may be preferable, but it has the nasty side-effect of
also producing the sharp sound of a broken string more often, and of putting extra strain
on the neck of the guitar, so it is recommended to tune to open D and use a capo on the
2nd fret. Open D/E is encountered in a number of the songs on <em>Freewheelin'</em>, and
the entire <em>Blood on the Tracks</em> was originally recorded in this tuning. For a more
thorough presentation of Dylan's use of the open D/E tuning, I refer to my <a href="16_bott/index.htm">introductory notes on Blood on the Tracks</a>.</p>

<strong><a href="16_bott/index.htm">Blood On The Tracks</a> </strong>(all the songs)</p>

<p><strong>Open G </strong>is the most common slide guitar tuning, popular among delta
blues players. Since Dylan was an old delta blues player himself in his early carreer,
you'll find a few songs in this tuning. The only song on this site, though, is <a href="00_misc/I_was_young_when_I_left_home.htm">I Was Young When I Left Home</a>.</p>

<p><tt>Open G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D G d g&nbsp;b d'</tt> </p>

<p><strong>Alternate tunings</strong></p>

<p>Again, there are really only three different tunings to keep track of in Dylan's
catalogue: drop D, drop C and double drop D (to my knowledge he's never played &quot;drop
dead&quot;). They all involve the 6th and deepest string: in drop D, the 6th string is
tuned one step down, and in drop C, two steps. In double drop D both the 1st and the 6th
strings are tuned down to D.</p>

<pre>Standard tuning	E A d g b e'
Drop D		D A d g b e'
Drop C		C A d g b e'
Double drop D	D A d g b d'</pre>

<p>All these tunings have their own distinct sets of chords, always centering around the
deepest bass tone. An example is the chord G. In drop D tuning, the central chord is D
(000232). Thus the natural way to finger G is 020033. In drop C, on the other hand, the
central chord is C (032010), and the most comfortable version of G is 220001. This is a G7
chord, and this is consequently the only tuning in which Dylan consistently uses the
dominant 7th chord, which he usually shuns. Another instructive example is <a href="06_hwy61/desolation_row.htm">Desolation Row</a>, where drop C is used on the album,
drop D in the live shows of 1965/66.</p>

<p>The three tunings had their periods. <strong>Double drop D</strong> is a thing of the
early days. Since the third in the D chord (on the first string) is gone, it's a perfect
tuning for modal, folky songs like <a href="03_times/ballad_of_hollis_brown.htm">Ballad of
Hollis Brown</a> or <a href="37_unplugged/john_brown.htm">John Brown</a>, or blues tunes like
<a href="00_misc/rocks_and_gravel.htm">Rocks And Gravel</a>, <a href="00_misc/motherless_children.htm">Motherless Children</a>, <a href="00_misc/west_texas.htm">West
Texas</a> and <a href="34_bootleg/quit_your_low_down_ways.htm">Quit Your Low Down Ways</a>.
<strong>Drop D </strong>is also favoured in the early days. It is not as insistently a
D-ish tuning as double drop D - it is more versatile, used both as a folky, modal tuning
as in Barbara Allen or Masters of War, and as a way of varying the sound of standard
three-chord songs like Mr Tambourine Man. <strong>Drop C</strong> is the favoured tuning
in 1965/66, both solo, with Robbie in hotel rooms and with the band on stage. It gives a
very forceful fundament, thanks to the doubled C in the bottom. <br>
The merit of all these tunings is the fuller sound they produce. This may be a need felt
by a solo acoustic act, but in a band, there is a bass player to fulfill that function.
Double drop D disappeared very early, and there are no drop C songs after the 1966 tour.
But on two songs he has been faithful to drop D, throughout his carreer: &quot;It's
alright ma&quot; and &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&quot;.</p>

<h2><a NAME="fingerpicking"></a><b>Fingerpicking</b> </h2>

<p>Although he doesn't use it much these days, many of the old songs use what I call
&quot;standard fingerpicking&quot;. I don't know if there is such a thing, but here is
what I mean, as an example. (Chords: G and C. 'h' in the second measure means hammer-on) </p>

<p><tt>&nbsp;

<tt>|-----0-------0---|-----2-------2---| thumb</tt> <br>
<tt>|-----------------|-----------------| (thumb)</tt> <br>
<tt>|-3-------3-------|-3-------3-------| thumb</tt> </p>

<p>The variations are of course unlimited, but the main principle is as rock solid as the
thumb ought to be: The thumb alternates between the bass strings, and the other fingers
fill in.</p>

harmonica keys</a> to Dylan's songs.</p>

<h2><a name="ScreenSettings">Screen Settings</a></h2>

<p>This is by no means conclusive or based on years of years of programming or web design,
just some general hints and tips.</p>

<p>1. This site is best viewed with a browser. All the files are in html-format. I like
the possibility of some formatting. The tabs themselves are no-frills plain text. The only
java you'll find here is in the links to the webring and the counters (and the gallons of
coffee I've consumed while tabbing). I received a mail from a blind person who had been
able to take advantage of the site thanks to this (not the coffee, that is), which made me
happy, not only for having chosen a sound principle. </p>

<p>2. Some of the tabs may be too wide to be seen comfortably on the screen, or for
printing. I haven't been consistent with the number of characters per line (my apologies
for that), and the left frame narrows the main window, of course. The brutal solution is
to move the bar between the two windows (click on it, hold and drag). Or use a smaller
text size (&quot;View&quot; menu). I use the &quot;smaller&quot; option (Internet
Explorer).</p>

<p>3. This is a good setting for print-outs too. Since the tabs are in a fixed-width font,
you may want to adjust the default setting for these (Tool menu). The default usually is
Courier. I've noticed that this font gives very thin letters, which may be difficult to
read (especially at candlelight, around a campfire, or wherever people play Dylan). I much
prefer Lucida Console, which gives thicker letters and less widely spaced tab lines, but
that's just my opinion.</p>
