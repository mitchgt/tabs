<p>I made a zip file of the entire archive. Just download the file, unzip it to a new
directory and open the file &quot;index.htm&quot;, that you'll find in that new directory,
and you can calmly sit back and hope for a rainy summer. Links that go outside the archive
of albums and tabs will be broken, of course. Please <a href="mailto:music@edlis.org">report</a>
any other problems.</p>

<p>The zip file was last updated Jul 3, 2002. If you want the files that have been added
since then, you'll have to save them one by one, and put them in the correct
subdirectories, then get all the new index-files. Maybe it's just as easy to wait for the
next update...</p>
