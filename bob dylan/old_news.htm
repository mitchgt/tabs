<p> <b>Sept 18: </b>
    Are you going to the north country fair, the concert in Stockholm Oct 11? If 
    so, you might want to consider going one day earlier, to catch the Dylan 
    tribute convention (or, if you're more comfortable with that: PARTY). Just 
    about every up and coming band in Sweden will be playing, as will a certain 
    upholder of a certain Dylan chord web site. More info
    <a href="http://www.blackside.org/dylan/en.htm">here</a>. <b> <br>

    While I've been<b> </b>
    away<b> </b>
    this site seems to have become something of a celebrity because of the
    <a href="41_lat/textual_sources.htm">Junichi Saga saga</a>, which apparently 
    made it to front pages here and there (meanwhile, I made it to the top of 
    Børringen, the mountain of my dreams, so to speak). Here's the Dixie 
    Hummingbirds' version of <a href="00_misc/city_of_gold.htm#DixieH">City of 
    Gold</a>, from the <i>Masked and Anonymous </i>soundtrack.<br>
    <b>June 17: </b>
    <a href="00_misc/you_dont_know_me.htm">You Don't Know Me</a> (various 
    locations, 1989-1991)<b><br>
    June 16: </b>
    My favorite version of <a href="03_times/times_they_are_achangin.htm#1981">
    The Times They Are A-Changin'</a> (Drammen 10 July 1981)&nbsp; turned<b> </b>
    up on my doorstep the other day. It was actually one of the first songs I 
    intended to tab, way back in history ('97, I think it was), but somehow I 
    never did, and then the CD disappeared. Now I have it again . . . (and it 
    still is one of my favorites - the whole show)
    <b><br>
May 30: </b>
    A more elaborate tab for <a href="38_toom/dirtroad.htm">Dirt Road Blues</a> 
    was requested, I assume in anticipation of the version in <i>Masked and 
    Anonymous </i>(cause since it is not out yet, clearly nobody has heard it, 
    right? :-).<b> </b>
    I never said it is easy, but don't despair - it <i>is </i>playable... Then 
    there was this Greendale stuff from Neil Young, which has been haunting me 
    for a couple of weeks now - hey, one of these days I may even turn into a 
    Young fan... Anyway, here's <a href="others/neil_young_devils_sidewalk.htm">
    Devil's Sidewalk</a> <b><br>
    May 29: </b>
    Another Neil Young Greendale tab: <a href="others/neil_young_double_e.htm">
    Double E</a> (live, Oslo/Frankfurt, 
Apr/May 2003)<b><br>
    May 23: </b>

    May 12: </b>Chris Johnson has read Junichi Saga's <i>Confessions of a Yakuza</i>, 
    and found a <a href="41_lat/textual_sources.htm">load of lines</a> that 
    strikingly resemble lines is a recent studio album by a certain American 
    icon (with a title that alludes to unlawful appropriation)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>
    <br>
    May 10:</b> The piano version of
    <a href="13_dylan/spanish_is_the_loving_tongue.htm#Outtake">Spanish Is The 
    Loving Tongue</a> (<i>New Morning </i>outtake, June 1970)<b> </b>is as good 
    as it gets, so it would be a shame to leave it out just because he plays on 
    the wrong instrument.<b> </b>I never said it was easy, but it is playable 
    .-)<b><br>
    May 9: </b><a href="00_misc/female_rambling_sailor.htm">
    Female Rambling Sailor</a> (played live six times in 1992). <br>
    And thank god it's spring. As they say in Toronto: &quot;It's spring, the Leaves 
    are out.&quot; I don't mind - Mats Sundin certainly found a way to make himself 
    useful elsewhere. Sorry Canada, but the only
    <a href="17_basement/one_single_river.htm">song for you</a> on Sunday will 
    be &quot;going down the road feeling bad&quot;. (If you don't understand a word of 
    what I'm saying here, you're probably not interested in hockey).<br>
    <b>May 7: </b><a href="00_misc/diamond_joe2.htm">Diamond Joe</a> 
    (from <i>Masked and Anonymous</i>, 2003). New outtake version of
    <a href="31_ohmercy/everything_is_broken.htm#Outtake">Everything is Broken</a><b><br>

    <a href="38_toom/doorway_chords.htm#Austin2003">Standing in the Doorway</a> 
    (Austin, 20 April 2003). I also added
    <a href="00_misc/dusty_old_fairgrounds.htm">Dusty Old Fairgrounds</a> (Town 
    Hall, NY, 12 Apr 1963), and the Minnesota Party Tape version of
    <a href="17_basement/young_but_daily_growin.htm">Young But Daily 
    Growing/Long Time A-Growin'</a> (May 1961)<b><br>

    version of Jimmie Rodgers's <a href="00_misc/mississippi_and_you.htm">Miss 
    the Mississippi and You</a>, from the Bromberg tapes (June 1992).<b><br>

    Forum</a> has been established at the <a href="http://pool.dylantree.com/">
    dylanpool</a>, thanks to ryan (who needed something to fill up his days now 
    that he has finished his exams - congratulations, ryan!) and Arthur, who put 
    it up.<strong> </strong>It will, as I see it, replace the Yahoo group My 
    Back Pages, as a more active forum for questions concerning Dylan and the 
    Guitar. Go there and prove me right!<br>
    <strong>Mar 1: </strong>Updated Christer Svensson's list of
    <a href="harp/harpkeys.htm">Harp keys</a> with Live 1975<strong><br>
    Feb 26: </strong>What appears to be a new site,
    <a href="http://digilander.libero.it/dylanchords/?">Strummin' on my gay 
    guitar</a>, contains chords to live versions of a lot of songs, mostly from 
    recent years. Since it is made as a &quot;complement&quot; to this site, it must be 
    good :-) (and I'm deeply honoured).<strong> </strong>Good initiative!<strong><br>
    Feb 19: </strong>I've done some updating of files here and there,
    among other things the full version of <a href="00_misc/cross_the_green_mountain.htm">Cross
    The Green Mountain</a>.<strong><br>
    Jan 17: </strong><a href="00_misc/cross_the_green_mountain.htm">Cross The Green Mountain</a>
    (<font face="Garamond" size="3"><em>Gods And Generals</em>, soundtrack, 2003)</font><strong><br>
    Jan 11: </strong><a href="00_misc/end_of_the_innocence.htm">The End Of The Innocence</a>
    (by Henley/Hornsby; fall 2002)<strong>. </strong>I also put up some Dan Bern songs (in the
    &quot;<a href="others/index.htm">Others</a>&quot; folder), and added some <a href="links.htm">links</a>.<strong><br>
    Jan 6, 2003: </strong>First of all: <strong>Godt nyttår, Happy new year, Bonan novjaron,
    etc. </strong>Second: a new addition to the &quot;Self-Ordained Professors&quot; section: <a href="professors/ritual_of_a_bob_dylan_concert_.htm"><em>&quot;Going Through These Things
    Twice&quot; - the Ritual of a Bob Dylan Concert</em></a>, which is a paper I held at a
    conference on &quot;postmodern medievalism&quot; (medievalism is defined as &quot;the
    ongoing (re)creation of the Middle Ages&quot;) - hence the emphasis on medieval ritual in
    the article). <br>
    And, yes, I promise - there will be some tabs here soon, too...</p>

<h2 align="left">Chords added 2002</h2>

<p align="left"><strong>Nov 28: </strong>Finally I got hold of Bootleg Series 5: <a
href="42_bs5/index.htm"><em>Live 1975 (The Rolling Thunder Revue)</em></a><strong><br>
Nov 17: </strong>I was reminded that there are four chords at the end of &quot;<a

Nov 4: </strong>New book: <em>The Four Voices of Bob Dylan</em> by Mike Daley, about Bob
Dylan's early singing style. Available on the Internet only. The full information and
ordering instructions can be found at: <a href="http://geocities.com/mdaley97/">http://geocities.com/mdaley97</a>.
For what it's worth: Mike is actually one of the inspirators of this site, so go there and
buy his book!<strong> <br>
Oct 24: </strong><a href="00_misc/old_man_neil_young.htm">Old Man</a> (by Neil Young; fall
2002).<strong><br>
Oct 23: </strong>Back from Iowa, Milwaukee and Philly, and what do I find, but another
fine cover: <a href="00_misc/carrying_a_torch_van_morrison.htm">Carrying a Torch</a> (Van
Morrison; Fall 2002).<strong> </strong>Then there's <a
href="00_misc/boom_boom_mancini_warren_zevon.htm">Boom Boom Mancini</a>, and <a
href="00_misc/lawyers_guns_and_money.htm">Lawyers, Guns and Money</a>, Dylan's versions. <strong><br>
Oct 10: </strong>Til mine danske gjester: Hva med en liten gettogether i København (siden
jeg nå bor her)? For eksempel et release party for <em>Bootleg Series 5 </em>når
(/hvis...) den kommer ut i November? <a href="mailto:eyolf@dylanchords.com">Send meg en
mail</a> med forslag om sted - puber der man kan regne med å få spille noe Dylan en
kveld, enten på CD eller også live. Det är givetvis öppet för malmöiter, lundensare
och annat svenskt också. :-) (och när jag nu ändå håller på: är det nån annan än
jag som tänker se Stefan Sundström&nbsp; i Lund den 6:e november?)<br>
<strong>Oct 10</strong>: The version of <a href="16_bott/youre_a_big_girl_now.htm#RTR">You're
a Big Girl Now</a> from the Rolling Thunder Revue 1976<br>
<strong>Oct 7: </strong>Turned out Dylan plays the same thing as Zevon, at least on <a
href="00_misc/accidentally_like_a_martyr.htm">Accidentally Like A Martyr</a>, which is now
complete.<strong><br>
Oct 6: </strong>Some tour opener: Three tribute songs to the same person in the same show
(someone said the last time that happened, it was Jesus...) - three Warren Zevon songs. I
haven't heard Dylan's versions yet, but here are Zevon's: <a
href="00_misc/accidentally_like_a_martyr.htm">Accidentally Like A Martyr</a>, <a
href="00_misc/boom_boom_mancini_warren_zevon.htm">Boom Boom Mancini</a>, and <a
href="00_misc/mutineer_warren_zevon.htm">Mutineer</a>. And what's with all this piano
playing - is he going to put me out of work, or what...?<strong><br>
Sept 5: </strong>There's some neat pickin' going on in the current version of <a
href="34_bootleg/mama_you_been_on_my_mind.htm">Mama You Been On My Mind</a><strong> </strong>-
here are two versions of it, one in C (<a
href="34_bootleg/mama_you_been_on_my_mind.htm#Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, 2001), and one in
G (<a href="34_bootleg/mama_you_been_on_my_mind.htm#Oslo">Oslo</a>, 2002).<strong><br>
Aug 23: </strong>Here's a little gem for the Scandinavian guests, with a little story to
go with it: One of the few records I had in my house when I was a kid was this strange old
man<strong> </strong>called <a href="others/povel_ramel_karl_nilsson.htm">Karl Nilsson</a>
who sang a song about himself. Little by little I realized that it was hilariously funny,
and that the singer wasn't an old senile emigrant after all,<strong> </strong>but a
Swedish entertainer called Povel Ramel. Apparently, the tune is an old emigrant song, and
Karl Nilsson is slightly related to the protagonist of the Swedish film &quot;The
Emigrants&quot;, about emigrants to America. This is reflected in the penultimate verse
(and it's the only Dylan connection I could find). <strong><br>
Aug 20: </strong>Here's the Rundown Rehearsal version of <a
href="16_bott/youre_gonna_make_me_lonesome.htm#Rundown">You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When
You Go</a> from 1978.<strong><br>
Aug 17: </strong>I did some simple <a href="statistics.htm">statistics</a> on the most
visited albums and songs<strong>.<br>
Aug 16: </strong>We've got a new opener: <a href="00_misc/voice_from_on_high.htm">Voice
From On High</a><strong> </strong>by Bill Monroe and Bessie Lee Mauldin, sung yesterday in
Hamburg, NY. The song has also been covered by the Stanley Brothers. Since I found the
songs one at a time, I've added all three versions<strong> </strong>(not that the
differences are <em>that</em> radical).<strong><br>
Aug 8: </strong>Safely back from Belgium (my, can they brew beer down there!), I've added
a new essay in the <a href="professors/index.htm"><em>Self-ordained Professors</em></a>
section: <a href="professors/matt_phillips_idiot_wind.htm">Preaching Into the Wind - An
appreciation of &#145;Idiot Wind&#146;</a> written by Matt Phillips.<strong><br>
July 3: </strong>My new home on the net! <a href="http://www.dylanchords.com">www.dylanchords.com</a>
should be easier to remember than hem.passagen.se/... how was it now...?<strong> </strong>Please
report broken links to <a href="mailto:eyolf%20AT%20dylanchords.com">eyolf@dylanchords.com</a>.<br>

Title Theme</a> from <em>Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid</em> (instrumental). I don't know
if it was worth it, but what's done is done.<strong><br>

href="02_freewheelin/dont_think_twice.htm#2001">Don't Think Twice</a> that is played these
days. Pretty, pretty!<strong> </strong>Oh, yes, and I was asked to do Frank Sinatra's <a

href="others/walk_around_heaven_all_day.htm">Walk Around Heaven All Day</a> (Sung by
Carolyn Dennis during the same tour).<strong><br>
Apr 18: </strong>Yesterday's version of Long Black Veil was of course the acoustic version
from George, Washington June 17, 2000, not the electric one from 1997 (found on <em>[Bathed
in a stream of] Pure Heat</em>)<em>.</em>Thanks to Patrik for notifying me<em>. </em><strong><br>

so. I haven't been able to upload to it either. Nor have I had much to upload, either, so
