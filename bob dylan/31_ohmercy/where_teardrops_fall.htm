<h1>Where Teardrops Fall</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan.<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Oh Mercy</em></a> (1989).<br>
Tabbed by Jeff Kokosinski, with slight emendations by Eyolf Østrem.</p>

<p>D' in the last line of the verses is basically a D and a G played at the same time on
different guitars. It can be emulated by playing a Dsus4 chord (xx0233).</p>

<pre>G
 Far away where the soft winds blow
                 C    Eb
Far away from it all
G
 There is a place you go
G     D'        G
Where teardrops fall.

Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>   C
We banged the drum slowly

And played the fife lowly
    G
You know the song in my heart
       C
In the turning of twilight

In the shadows of moonlight
        Cm                     D
You can show me a new place to start.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I've torn my clothes and I've drained the cup
Strippin' away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>By rivers of blindness
In love and with kindness
We could hold up a toast if we meet
To the cuttin' of fences 
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Roses are red violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come to see you
Where teardrops fall.</pre>
