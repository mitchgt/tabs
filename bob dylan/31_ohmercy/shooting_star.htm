<h1>Shooting Star</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan.<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Oh Mercy</em></a> (1989) and in a live version on <em><a
href="../37_unplugged/index.htm">Unplugged</a> </em>(1995).<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>B'' (in the bridge) is a chord with a whole lot of tones in it, on several guitars,
playing quite different chords. A good approximation is x22324.</p>

<p>In the outtake version the song is clearly played in C, with a capo on the 4th fret
(see below). On <em>Unplugged</em> Dylan plays his licks without a capo, while Jackson
uses the capo on the 4th fret.</p>

Seen a shooting star tonight 
      A              E
And I thought of you
E                               E/g#
You were trying to break into another world
  A
A world I never knew
A                B             
I always kind of wondered 
       E            A
if you ever made it through
       E               E/g#
Seen a shooting star tonight
      A             E
And I thought of you.

Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me 
If I was still the same If I ever became 
what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line 
that only you could see
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me.</pre>

As the last firetruck from hell

goes rolling by, all good people are praying

It's the last temptation the last account

The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
A                 B''
The last radio is playing.

Tomorrow will be another day
Guess it's too late to say the things to you 
that you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight slip away.</pre>
