<h1>What Can I Do For You</h1>

<p>Words and Music by Bob Dylan <br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Saved</a> </em>(1980)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 3rd fret (original key Eb major).<br>
See below for a transcription of the final harmonica solo (Eb harp, straight. The
transcription is in C major).<br>
I have also attached a <a HREF="WHATCAN.mid">MIDI file</a>, not to listen to, but to save
locally and insert into Javier Argomedo's program &quot;Harping&quot; (<a HREF="http://www.freeyellow.com/members6/harping/">download</a> it from his site), which
will produce a harp tabulature - useful if you're not used to reading a score.</p>

<pre>Am  G F Am bis</pre>

<pre>C   Am   F                   G
You have given everything to me. 
           F  F/G  C
What can I do for You? 
C   Am   F                G
You have given me eyes to see.  
           F  F/G  C
What can I do for You?</pre>

<pre>Am               C/G             F               C/E
Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside, 
Am          G               C           Dm
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied, 
Am                  C/G                  F         C/E   Dm
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide 
           Am           C/G          F
And You've chosen me to be among the few.  
                  C
What can I do for You?</pre>

<pre>You have laid down Your life for me. 
What can I do for You? 
You have explained every mystery. 
What can I do for You?</pre>

<pre>Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly, 
He gets wise in his own eyes and he's made to believe a lie. 
Who would deliver him from the death he's bound to die? 
Well, You've done it all and there's no more anyone can pretend to do. 
What can I do for You?</pre>

<pre>You have given all there is to give. 
What can I do for You? 
You have given me life to live. 
How can I live for You?</pre>

<pre>I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts, 
I don't care how rough the road is, show me where it starts, 
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart. 
Well, I don't deserve it but I sure did make it through. 
What can I do for You?</pre>
