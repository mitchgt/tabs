<h1>Fourth Time Around</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Blonde on Blonde</em></a> (1966) and in a live version
on <a href="../39_rah/index.htm"><em>Live 1966</em></a> (1998)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 4th fret (sounding key E major)<br>
And you might as well tune down the E string two steps, to get the dropped C tuning that
he uses on Live 1966 (C-A-d-g-b-e').</p>

<p>The versions are quite similar, apart from (1) the little riff running through the
album version, and (2) the basic chord alternation, which in the album version is C - F,
and on <em>Live 1966 </em>C - Csus4. (it actually sounds like that's what Dylan is playing
in the album version as well, but the little riff clearly alternates between C and F, so
that's the predominant sound anyway).</p>

<pre>C    F               C
When she said,&quot;Don't waste 
     F                   C
your words, they're just lies,&quot;
  F             C         F   C   F
I cried she was deaf.
    C   F            C
And she worked on my face 
      F           C
until breaking my eyes,
           F                  C      F   C  F
Then said, &quot;What else you got left?&quot;
       Em        
It was then that I got up to leave
                        Dm
But she said, &quot;Don't forget,
     C         F              C
Everybody must give something back
    F              C       F  C  F
For something they get.&quot;

I stood there and hummed,
I tapped on her drum and asked her how come.
And she buttoned her boot,
And straightened her suit,
Then she said, &quot;Don't get cute.&quot;
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs,
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum.

She threw me outside,
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.
And after finding I'd
Forgotten my shirt,
I went back and knocked.
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against . . .

Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some.
She said, &quot;No, dear.&quot;
I said, &quot;Your words aren't clear,
You'd better spit out your gum.&quot;
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor,
And I covered her up and then
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.

And, when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you.
And you, you took me in,
You loved me then
You didn't waste time.
And I, I never took much,
I never asked for your crutch.
Now don't ask for mine.</pre>
