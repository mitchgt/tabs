<h1>One Of Us Must Know (Sooner Or Later)</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">Blonde on Blonde</a> </em>(1966)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)<br>
The 2nd guitar is probably playing with a capo on the 1st fret and chords in E major </p>

<p>*) If you include the note in the piano here, you would get a Dm/f chord</p>

<p>In the refrain there is a nice bass line that one can get by playing the chords:</p>

<pre>C . G/b . |F/a . C/g . |F . C/e . |G</pre>

<p>BTW, this is the same line as in the refrain of <a

I didn't mean to treat you so bad
F             C      (F) G(sus4)      G
You shouldn't take it so personal
  C                       F  C 
I didn't mean to make you so sad
F        C          (F) G               (Gsus4-G)
You just happened to be there, that's all
Am                                   Em
When I saw you say &quot;goodbye&quot; to your friend and smile
Dm                         C
I thought that it was well understood
Am                             Em
That you'd be comin' back in a little while
Dm                                     F              G
  I didn't know that you were sayin' &quot;goodbye&quot; for good</pre>

But, sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C                  G
That you just did what you're supposed to do
C         G      F	        C
Sooner or later, one of us must know
F             C              G
That I really did try to get close to you</pre>

<pre>
I couldn't see what you could show me
Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
I couldn't see how you could know me
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
I didn't realize just what I did hear
I didn't realize how young you were</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>But, sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I couldn't see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn't see where we were goin'
But you said you knew an' I took your word
And then you told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
An' I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>But, sooner or later, one of us must know
You just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
