Nobody feels any pain

Tonight as I stand inside the rain 
F         G7
Ev'rybody knows 
     F              G7
That Baby's got new clothes 
    F   Em/b Dm C       F               G7
But lately   I  see her ribbons and her bows 
     Am     F        G7
Have fallen from her curls. 
    C     Em/b Dm     F
She takes just like a woman, yes she does,
    C     Em/b Dm     F
she makes love like a woman, yes she does,
             C     Em/b Dm     F
And then she aches just like a woman, 
        G7                        C      Csus4  C  Csus4  C
but she breaks just like a little girl.</pre>

<pre>Queen Mary, she's my friend 
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again 
Nobody has to guess 
That Baby can't be blessed 
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest 
With her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls. 
She takes just like a woman,
And she makes love like a woman,
And she aches just like a woman 
But she breaks just like a little girl.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>       E                   
It was raining from the first 

And I was dying there of thirst 
     C            Csus4 C
So I came in here 
         E
And your long-time curse hurts 

But what's worse 
        F
Is this pain in here 
        G7
I can't stay in here 
 
Ain't it clear that</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>C F    G     C    etc.
I just don't fit 
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit 
And when we meet again 
Introduced as friends 
Please don't let on that you knew me when 
I was hungry and it was your world. 
You take just like a woman,
And you take just like a woman, yes you do 
And you make love like a woman, yes you do
and then you ache just like a woman,
but you break just like a little girl.</pre>

<h3>Blonde on Blonde version</h3>

<p>Bob seems to be playing with a capo on the 4th fret, and more or less the same chords
as above.<br>
The 2nd guitar plays without a capo, using the following pattern (w/variations):</p>

<pre>  E           A     B7      E

<p>The easiest way to play the G7sus4 G7 G7sus2 G7 figure (same as in Sad-Eyed Lady) would
be:</p>

<h3>&quot;Before the Flood&quot; version</h3>

<p>Played in a very square 4/4 beat. The chords marked &quot;/B&quot;are probably G/B, but
may even be C/B (or rather: Cadd2/b: x20010). The second and third Choruses are rushed out
of tempo.</p>

<p>* These Am chords are Ds in subsequent verses.</p>
