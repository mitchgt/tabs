G      
Standing on your window, honey,
C              D      G
Yes, I've been here before.
G      
Feeling so harmless,
    C               D      G
I'm looking at your second door.
D                                      G
How come you don't send me no regards?
    G                D7
You know I want your lovin',
                      G
Honey, why are you so hard?</pre>

Kneeling 'neath your ceiling,
Yes, I guess I'll be here for a while.
I'm tryin' to read your portrait, but,
I'm helpless, like a rich man's child.
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your lovin',
Honey, why are you so hard?</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>       Em 
Like a poor fool in his prime,
                    Bm
Yes, I know you can hear me walk,
            Em
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime,
Bm              D7         D7sus4
  Or is it just solid rock?
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Well, I rush into your hallway,
Lean against your velvet door.
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor.
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your lovin', Honey, but you're so hard.

Achilles is in your alleyway,
He don't want me here,
He does brag.
He's pointing to the sky
And he's hungry, like a man in drag.
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your lovin',
Honey. but you're so hard.</pre>
