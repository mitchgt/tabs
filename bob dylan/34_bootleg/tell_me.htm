<h1>Tell Me</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded spring 1983 during the <em><a href="../25_infidels/index.htm">Infidels</a> </em>sessions,
released on <em><a href="index.htm">The Bootleg Series 1-3</a> </em>(1991)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The Bs are tinted with B7.<br>
The Es at the end of the three-line verses glide into E7 when more of these verses follow
eachother.</p>

<pre>     E               B
Tell me, I've got to know.
     E                    B
Tell me, tell me before I go.</pre>

  <pre>          A          
Does that fire still burn? Does that flame still glow?
   E
Or has it died out and melted like the snow.
     B        E     (E7)
Tell me. Tell me.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Tell me, what are you focused upon?
Tell me, will it come to me after you're gone? *)</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Tell me now with a glance on the side.
Shall I hold you close or let you go by?
Tell me. Tell me.</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Is that the heat and the beat of your pulse that I feel?
If it's not that, then what is it that you're trying to conceal?
Do you have any secrets that will only come out in time?</pre>
  <pre>Do you lie in your bed do you stare at the stars?
Is your main friend someone who's an old acquaintance of ours?
Tell me. Yes, tell me.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Tell me, are those rock 'n' roll dreams in your eyes?
Tell me behind what door your treasure lies.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Ever gone broke in a big way?
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say?
Tell me. Tell me.</pre>
  <pre>Is it some kind of game that you're playin' with my heart
How deep must I go, where do I start? 
Do you have any morals? Do you have any point of view?</pre>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Is that a smile that I see on your face?
Will it lead me to glory or lead me to disgrace?
Tell me. Tell me.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Tell me, is that my name in your book?
Tell me, will you go back and take another look?</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Tell me the truth, don't tell me no lies.
Are you anybody, someone, prays for, or cries?
Tell me. Tell me.</pre>
