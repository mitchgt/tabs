<h1>She's Your Lover Now</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan <br>
Recorded Jan 21, 1966 during the <em><a href="../07_bob/index.htm">Blonde on Blonde</a> </em>sessions,
and released on <em><a href="index.htm">The Bootleg Series 1-3</a></em> (1991)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The &quot;Piano song&quot; <em>par exellence</em>, it takes some skill and some will
(and it's revealing!) to make it sound good on a guitar. The original is one half tone
higher, in C# major, so use a capo on the 1st fret.<br>
Note the similarity with <em><a href="../06_hwy61/like_a_rolling_stone.htm">Like A Rolling
Stone</a>.</em></p>

<pre><tt>C&nbsp;&nbsp; Dm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C/e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt>
<tt>Somebody&nbsp; better explain 
C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C/e&nbsp; F
She's got her iron chain,</tt> 
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dm&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C/E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G</tt> 
<tt>I'd do it, but I just can't remember how</tt> 
<tt>Am&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G</tt> 
<tt>You talk to her</tt> 
<tt>F&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; G</tt> 
<tt>She's your lover now.</tt> </pre>

<pre>I already assumed 
That we were in the felony room 
But I ain't a judge, you don't have to be nice to me 
Will you please tell that 
To your friend in the cowboy hat 
You know he keeps on sayin' everything twice to me 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know I was straight with you 
       You know I never tried to change you in any way 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You know if you didn't want to be with me&nbsp; 
       That you didn't have to stay. 
Now you stand here sayin' you forgive and forget. 
Honey, what can I say? 
And you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can't you reach? 
I see you kiss her on the cheek everytime she gives a speech 
With her picture books of the pyramid 
And her postcard of billy the kid 
why must evrybody bow? 
You better talk to her about it 
You're her lover now. </pre>

<pre>Oh everybody that cares Is goin' up the castle stairs 
But I'm not up in your castle, honey, 
It's true, I can't recall San Francisco at all 
I can't even rember El Paso, uh , honey 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You never had to be faithful 
    I didn't want you to grieve 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, why was it so hard to you 
    If you didn't want to be with me, just to leave? 
Now&nbsp; you stand here 
while your finger's goin' up my sleeve 
An' you, just what do you do, anyway? Ain't there nothing you can say? 
She'll be standin' on the bar soon 
With a fish head an' a harpoon 
An' a fake beard plastered on her brow 
You'd better do somethin' quick 
She's your lover now. </pre>

<pre>Oh, why must I fall into this sadness? 
Do I look like Charles Atlas? 
Do you think I still got what you still got, baby? 
Her voice is really warm 
It's just that it ain't got no form 
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, your mouth used to be naked, 
    your eyes used to be so blue 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your hurts used to be so nameless 
    and your tears used to be so few 
Now your eyes cry wolf while your mouth cries: 
&quot;I'm not scared of animals like you.&quot;
And you there's really nothing about you I can recall 
I just saw you that one time and you were just there that's all 
But I've already been kissed, 
I'm not gonna get into this 
I couldn't make it anyhow 
You do it for me 
You're her lover now</pre>
