<pre>G             C/g
Listen to me, baby,

There's something you must see.
G                 C/g
I want to be with you, gal,
G'/d                   D7(/f#)
If you want to be with me.</pre>

It's all right.

<pre>It ain't that I'm questionin' you.
To take part in any quiz.
It's just that I ain't got no watch
An' you keep askin' me what time it is.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>But if you got to go,
It's all right.
But if you got to go, go now,
Or else you gotta stay all night.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I am just a poor boy, baby,
Lookin' to connect.
But I certainly don't want you thinkin'
That I ain't got any respect.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>But if you got to go,
It's all right.
But if you got to go, go now,
Or else you gotta stay all night.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>You know I'd have nightmares
And a guilty conscience, too,
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>But if you got to go,
It's all right.
But if you got to go, go now,
Or else you gotta stay all night.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>It ain't that I'm wantin'
Anything you never gave before.
It's just that I'll be sleepin' soon,
It'll be too dark for you to find the door.</pre>

<h3><em>Bootleg Series 1-3 </em>version</h3>

<p>The phrase end lick is basically a succession of Gs and Bbs, with some prominence to
the Bb.</p>

<p>The G - C/g - G figure is somewhat more elaborate here than elsewhere. The el-guitar
playes a little figure that would have to be played something like:</p>

<pre>  G       C/g   G      
  |   .   .   .     |   .   .
|(3)--------------|----------
|-3---3---5-6-5-3-|-----3----
|-4---4---5-----4-|-----4---- etc
|-5---5---5-----5-|-----5----
|-----------------|----------
|-----------------|----------</pre>

<p>or something to that effect.</p>

<pre>G </pre>

<pre>G             C
Listen to me, baby,
        G                  C
There's something you must see.
G                 C
I want to be with you, gal,
G n.c.[lick]                   
If you want to be with me.         </pre>

<blockquote>

But if you got to go,
C/g      G      C/g  G
It's all right.
                  C      G
But if you got to go, go now,
   D7 [lick]               G
