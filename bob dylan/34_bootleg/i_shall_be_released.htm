They say ev'rything can be replaced,

G                   Am

Of ev'ry man who put me here.</pre>

<pre>
They say ev'ry man needs protection,
They say ev'ry man must fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Now yonder standing here in this lonely crowd,
a man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Crying out that he was framed.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now, any day now,
I shall be released.</pre>

<h3>Alternate lyrics </h3>

<p>From the Martin Luther King Jr. Tribute, Washington, DC&nbsp; January 20, 1986 </p>

<p>They say every man needs protection<br>
They say that every man must fall<br>
I swear i see my own reflection<br>
Somewhere so high above this wall</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see my light come shinin'<br>
  I don't need no doctor or no priest<br>
  Any day now, any day now<br>
  I shall be released</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It don't take much to be a criminal<br>
One wrong move and they'll turn you into one<br>
At first decay is just subliminal<br>
To protect yourself and your forever on the run</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see my light come shinin'<br>
  I don't need no doctor or no priest<br>
  Any day now, any day now<br>
  I shall be released</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He will find you where your stayin'<br>
Even in the arms of somebody elses wife<br>
Your laughin' now, you should be prayin'<br>
To be in the midnight hour of your life </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I see my light come shinin'<br>
  I don't need no doctor or no priest<br>
  Any day now, any day now<br>
  I shall be released</p>
