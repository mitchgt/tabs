Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,

I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.
           C    
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
                   G  
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.
Am                      Bm                    C                 D
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room
              G
With a golden loom.

First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom 
With your golden loom.

I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom.</pre>
