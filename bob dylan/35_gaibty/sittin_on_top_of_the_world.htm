<h1>Sittin' On Top Of The World</h1>

<p>Trad.<br>
Released by Bob Dylan on <em><a href="index.htm">Good as I Been To You</a> </em>(1992)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>It seems that the B is played with an open E string: x24400, but the full B chord
x24442 is fine too; you don't really need those high strings anyway, since mostly the song
is played only on the bass strings.</p>

<p>The E4 chord (E on the fourth fret) = xxx454. Could be played on the seventh fret as
well (079990)</p>

<p>Standard blues accompaniment:</p>

<pre>           E       
Was in the summer,
   
One early fall,
               A
Just tryin' to find my
               E
Little all and all
          E4
Now she's gone,
            B
An' I don't worry.
          A                     E
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.</pre>

[this is the model also for the remaining interludes]

Was in the spring,
One summer's day.
Just when she left me,
She gone to stay.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.</pre>

Now don't come runnin'
Holdin' up your hand.
Can get me a woman
Quick as you can get a man.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

Happen for days,
Didn't know your name.
Oh, why should I worry
Or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

Went to the station,
Down in the yard,
Gonna get me a freight train,
Work's done got hard.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.

The lonesome days,
They have gone by,
Why should I beg you?
You said good-bye.
Now she's gone.
An' I don't worry.
Lord, I'm sittin' on top of the world.</pre>
