   Tomorrow night

         Am    B7                            E  Fdim F#m  B7   
Tomorrow night   will all the thrill be gone

Tomorrow night

your heart is beating fast

And you willingly surrender   
C#m        B       A       B7  
to me, but darling will it last </pre>

<pre>Tomorrow night 
will you be with me when the moon is bright 
Tomorrow night 
will you say those lovely things you said tonight </pre>

<pre>Your lips are so tender, 
your heart is beating fast 
And you willingly surrender 
to me, but darling will it last </pre>
