Fat man lookin in a blade of steel 

Thin man lookin at his last meal 
F                      C
Hollow man lookin in a cottonfield 
             F/g  C
For dignity</pre>

<pre>Wise man lookin in a blade of grass 
Young man lookin in the shadows that pass 
Poor man lookin through painted glass 
For dignity</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>G
Somebody got murdered on New Years Eve 
F                             C
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave 
       F                   C/e
I went into the city, went into the town 
              Dm                   F/g
Went into the land of the midnight sun</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Searchin high, searchin low 
Searchin everywhere I know 
Askin the cops wherever I go 
Have you seen dignity?</pre>

<pre>Blind man breakin out of a trance 
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance 
Hopin' to find one circumstance 
Of dignity</pre>

<pre>I went to the wedding of Mary-Lou 
She said I dont want nobody see me talkin to you 
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew 
About dignity</pre>

<pre>I went down where the vultures feed 
I would've gone deeper, but there wasnt any need 
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men 
Wasnt any difference to me</pre>

<pre>Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade 
House on fire, debts unpaid 
Gonna stand at the window, gonna ask the maid 
Have you seen dignity?</pre>

<pre>Drinkin' man listens to the voice he hears 
In a crowded room full of covered up mirrors 
Lookin into the lost forgotten years 
For dignity</pre>

<pre>Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues 
Said hed give me information if his name wasn't used 
He wanted money up front, said he was abused 
By dignity</pre>

<pre>Footprints runnin cross the silver sand 
Steps goin down into tattoo land 
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light 
In the bordertowns of despair</pre>

<pre>Got no place to fade, got no coat 
I'm on the rollin river in a jerkin boat 
Tryin' to read a note somebody wrote 
About dignity</pre>

<pre>Sick man lookin' for the doctors cure 
Lookin' at his hands for the lines that were 
And into every masterpiece of literature 
For dignity</pre>

<pre>Englishman stranded in the blackheart wind 
Combin' his hair back, his future looks thin 
Bites the bullet and he looks within 
For dignity</pre>

<pre>Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed 
Dignity never been photographed 
I went into the red, went into the black 
Into the valley of dry bone dreams</pre>

<pre>So many roads, so much at stake 
So many dead ends, I'm at the edge of the lake 
Sometimes I wonder what its gonna take 
To find dignity</pre>
