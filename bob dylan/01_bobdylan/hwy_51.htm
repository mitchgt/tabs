<h1>Highway 51 Blues</h1>

<p>Recorded by Bob Dylan on <a href="index.htm"><em>Bob Dylan</em></a> (1961) <br>
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem </p>

<hr>

<p><br>
Played in open <a HREF="../roadmaps.htm#opentunings">D/E tuning</a>. The song is played in
E, so either tune in open E or (recommended) in open D with a capo on the 2nd fret. The
basic chords are: </p>

<pre>E&nbsp;&nbsp; 000000 
A&nbsp;&nbsp; 020120 
B&nbsp;&nbsp; x02100 </pre>

<p>The most dominant riff that goes through the whole song, or rather: wherever there is
an E&nbsp; chord, is (it is mainly played on the bass strings, but of course it doesn't
matter if more strings are sounding): </p>

<p>There are other riffs, but they are all mainly variations on the same theme: open
strings and strings stopped on the 3rd fret. One might even use one's own imagination... </p>

<pre>E 
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
A                                  E 
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
     B 
If I don't get the girl I'm loving 
                               E 
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more. 


Well, I know that highway like I know my hand 
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand 
Running from up Wisconsin 
way down to no man's land. 

Well, if I should die before my time should come 
And if I should die before my time should come 
Won't you bury my body 
out on the Highway 51. 

Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
I said, Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door 
If I don't get the girl I'm loving 
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more. </pre><HR>
