There is a house down in New Orleans 
     Am       C/g    E
they call the rising sun
         Am       C/g     D/f#        F    
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl 
    Am     E        Am
and me, oh God, I'm one.</pre>

My mother was a tailor, 
she sowed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, 
down in New Orleans.

Now the only thing a gambler needs 
is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time when he's satisfied 
is when he's on a drunk.

He fills his glasses up to the brim 
and he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life 
is rambling from town to town.
 
Oh tell my baby sister 
not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans 
they call the rising sun.

Well with one foot on the platform 
and the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans 
to wear that ball and chain.

I'm going back to New Orleans, 
my race is almost run
I'm going back to end my life 
down in the rising sun.

There is a house in New Orleans 
they call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl 
and me, oh God, I'm one.
