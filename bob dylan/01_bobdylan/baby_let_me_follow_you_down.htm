<h1>Baby Let Me Follow You Down</h1>

<p>(trad./Eric Von Schmidt) <br>
Released by Bob Dylan on <em><a href="index.htm">Bob Dylan</a> </em>(1962) and on <a href="../28_biograph/index.htm"><em>Biograph</em></a> (1985), and in a live version on <a href="../39_rah/index.htm"><em>Live 1966</em></a> (1998)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)<br>
Chords (The F is played with a hammer-on from the open 6th string):</p>

<pre>Eb/g   3xx343
G/b    7xx787
D/a    5xx775 or x0x775
C/e    000553
D/f#   200232
C/g    332010</pre>

<p>He doesn't always get the descent (&quot;I'll do anything...&quot;) right - sometimes
it seems he just sends the thumb away to some bass string (sometimes both the E and the
A). Especially the G/b - it is generally so blurred that it's apparent that he's fingering
<em>something</em> - most logically the 7th fret with the thumb - but the <em>b </em>rarely
sounds, and at times he just plays an E on the open 6th string.</p>

<h3>Live 1966 version</h3>

<p>Differences from the above: 

<ul>
  <li>Capo 2nd fret (Dylan's guitar anyway. Robbie may be playing without a capo)</li>
  <li>The F has much more of a Dm about it (sounds better as an Em or a G6 (320000) without a
    capo - but it's probably Garth on the organ)</li>
  <li>The Eb/g is played as a straight Eb (F without capo)</li>
  <li>The subtleties of the bass line . . .&nbsp; well, what's a bass player there for anyway?</li>
</ul>

<pre>G                      F     C                      Eb
Baby let me follow you down, baby let me follow you down
          G     D             C           D
Well I'll do anything in this godalmighty world
       C           D          G
If you just let me follow you down.
