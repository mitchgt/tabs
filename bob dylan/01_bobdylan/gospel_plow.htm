<pre>     D
Mary wore three links of chain,
      A              D
Ev'ry link was Jesus name,
            G            A          D   [fill]
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
    A         D   [fill]
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
            G            A          D   [fill]
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.


Mary, Mark and Luke and John,
All these prophets so good and gone,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

I never been to heaven, but Ive been told,
Streets up there are line with gold,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

Dig my grave with a bloody spade,
See that my digger gets well paid,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

That gospel line gets mighty hot,
But just hang on with all you got,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.

When I get to the glory land,
Gonna play in the glory land,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on,
Oh, Lord, Oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on.</pre><HR>
