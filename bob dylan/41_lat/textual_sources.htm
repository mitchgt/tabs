 translation of Junichi Saga's <i>Confessions of a Yakuza</i> 
(translated by John Bester) and used on Love and
 
 Theft:

<p>Well, there you have it! It's a fascinating read in it's own right, and  
 obviously Dylan liked it. What more recommendation could you possibly  
 need?! It's available quite cheap in paperback from amazon.
