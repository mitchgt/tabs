<h1>Moonlight</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Love And Theft</em></a> (2001)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>Chords:</p>

<pre>Bb6    x1303x                 C#o    x45353
Dm7-5  xx0111 or x5656x       Bb/d   x5333x
Cm7-5  x3434x                 C9     x35333
Dm/f   xx3231                 F+     x4322x
Bo     x23131</pre>

<p>A more logical (or at least euphonious) progression at the end of the intro and other
places, would be Bb Bo Cm C#o. Bb/b matches what Dylan sings... Euphony never was his
middle name anyway.<br>
The Dm7 at &quot;meet me&quot; sounds like a Dm7-5 in some verses, but since that clashes
with the singing, I'd recommend a plain Dm7.<br>
The figure at the end of the bridge is transcribed according to what is played. The chord
names in the tab are more or less what results if the bass and the song are considered; in
the text I've suggested a simpler version that does more or less the same (Dm/f - F+ - F7
- F+).<br>
And remember: the bass notes that are played too early, which gives the swing character.</p>

out in the moonlight alone

The dusky light the day is losing
Orchids, poppies, black-eyed susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won't you meet me

out in the moonlight alone     </pre>

<pre>The air is thick and heavy
All along the levee
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won't you meet me

Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony

The blessings of tranquility

Yet I know when the time is right to strike

I take you 'cross the river, dear

<pre>The clouds are turning crimson
The leaves fall from the limbs and
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won't you meet me 
out in the moonlight alone

The boulevards of cypress trees
The masquerade of birds and bees
The petals pink and white, the wind has blown
Won't you meet me 
out in the moonlight alone</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>The trailing moss in mystic glow
The purple blossom soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love?
It tolls for you and me.  *)</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Old pulses running through my palm
The sharp hills are rising from
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Won't you meet me 
out in the moonlight alone</pre>
