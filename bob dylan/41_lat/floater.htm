<p>I've written in the melody line from the violin part in the intro; it's a bit awkward,
but it can be done, if you absolutely want to (otherwise, it sounds better with the chord
indicated in the chord list). If played with a capo on the 1st fret, it is actually a bit
easier to get this part right. If only for that reason, I include such a version at the
end of the page.</p>

<p>Chords:</p>

<pre>F7     xx3545        Ebm    x68876
F#o    xx4545        Dm     x57765
F#7    xx4656        A7     575655
Fo     xx3434        C/e    x7558x
Bb     688766        F      x87565
Eb7    x68686        Bb6    x13333</pre>

<p>Not only the music is &quot;borrowed&quot;; Chris Johnson has discovered that most of 
the text lines are taken from Junichi Saga's novel <i>Confessions of a Yakuza</i> 
(translated by John Bester). See <a href="textual_sources.htm">this survey</a> 
of all the lines borrowed from that book, or see the references below.</p>

<pre>F7    Fo      F7
Down over the window
         Bb       Eb7    Bb
Come the dazzling sunlit rays
            F7           Fo          F7
Through the back alleys, through the blinds,
                Bb          Ebm     Bb
Another one of them endless days.


Honey bees are buzzing
Leaves begin to stir
I'm in love with my second cousin           Bb    A7
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Dm                   A7
I keep listening for footsteps,
Dm                        Bb     A7
 But I ain't ever hearing any.
Dm                        A7
From the boat, I fish for bullheads
  Dm               C/e       F . . Fo  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many. </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>A summer breeze is blowin',
A squall is setting in.
Sometimes it's just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind. </pre>

<pre>[intro]

Well, the old men 'round here sometimes they get on               1<a name="*)">)</a>
bad terms with the younger men,
Old, young - age don't carry weight
It doesn't matter in the end                                      

One of the bosses' hangers-on sometimes comes to call
At times you least expect,
Tryin' to bully you, strong-arm you, inspire you with fear.
It has the opposite effect </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town        <a name="**)">2)</a>
The old one - long gone.
Timber, two foot six across,
Burns with the bark still on.                                </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>They say times are hard,
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose.
It don't bother me, times are hard everywhere,
We will just have to see how it goes. </pre>

<pre>[intro]</pre>

<pre>My old man he's like some feudal lord,                            <a name="***)">3)</a>
Got more lives than a cat.                                        
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once.             <a name="****)">4)</a>
Things come alive or they fall flat.                              

You can smell the pine wood burnin'
You can hear the school-bell ring.
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can
If you wanna learn anything. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Romeo, he said to Juliet, &quot;You got a poor complexion
It don't give you an appearance of a youthful touch.&quot;
Juliet said back to Romeo, &quot;Why don't you just shove off     <a name="*****)">5)</a>
If it bothers you so much.&quot;                                   </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>They all got out of here any way they could - 
Cold rain can give you the shivers.
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,
All the rest of them rebel rivers. </pre>

<pre>[intro]
</pre>

<pre>If you ever try to interfere with me, or cross my path again,
You do so at the peril of your own life.
I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound,                    <a name="6)">6)</a>
I've seen enough heartache and strife. 

My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I had 'em once though I suppose
To go along with all the ring dancing, 
		Christmas Carols on all the Christmas Eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Not always easy kicking someone out,                              <a name="7)">7)</a>
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task.                 
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And, tears or not, it's too much to ask.                          <a name="8)">8)</a></pre>
