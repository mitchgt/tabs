  G(6)                              C                D      Em
I met her on the station steps in a land far from my own
                 C  D
As if that meant anything
I bought us some coffee and we blew on our hands
As if that meant anything
She laughed when I mispronounced her name
As if that meant anything
One thing led to another thing, I led her to a place for drinking wine
As if that meant anything</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>            Em               C        D
And there's one more star in heaven tonight
Em              C       D
One more candle burning bright
            Em                 C  D
There'll be one more sunset by twilight

<pre>
For me the country was a foreign one, the town was not her own
As if that meant anything
I made her say her name again, she laughed when I wrote it down
As if that meant anything
We spent the night together wrapped tight in each other's arms
As if that meant anything
The morning I made breakfast and I bade her farewell
As if that meant anything</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>And there's one more star in heaven tonight
One more candle burning bright
There'll be one more sunset by twilight
One more light</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I met her six weeks later in a town to the south
As if that meant anything
One glance at her face and I knew something was wrong
As if that meant anything
She said the night we spent was a night to remember in more was than one
As if that meant anything
She said I received a child from you, that curious literal translation
As if that meant anything</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>And there's one more star 
One more candle 
There'll be one more sunset 
One more light</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>She looked at me and asked me what I thought she ought to do
As if that meant anything
I told her in five days I would be flying on a plane back home
As if that meant anything
I held her and brushed away her tears
As if that meant anything
I kept telling myself &quot;man, you've only met the girl twice&quot;
As if that meant anything</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>And there's one more star in heaven tonight
One more candle burning bright
There'll be one more sunset by twilight
One more light</pre>
