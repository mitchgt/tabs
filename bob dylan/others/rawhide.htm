Folks  here's a story 'bout Minnie the Moocher; 
C7                H7
she was a red hot hoochie  coocher. 
 She was the roughest  toughest frail; 
but Minnie had a heart as big as a whale. 

 Hi de hi de hi de hi 
 Ho de ho de ho de ho 
 Hee de hee de hee de hee 
 Ho oo waooo waoooo 

 She messed around with a bloke named Smokey; 
She loved him  though he was kokey. 
 He took her down to Chinatown 
and showed her how to kick the gong around. 

 Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi 
 Ho-whooooaaaa-ahhhh-ohh 
 He-de-he-de-hee-de-he 
 Ho-oh-ho-oh 
 She had a dream about the king of Sweden; 
he gave her things, that she was 
 needin'. 
 He gave her a home built of gold and steel, 
a diamond car, with the puh-latinum 
 wheels. 
 Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi 
 Ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-ho-de-oh 
 Skeedle-a-booka-diki biki skeedly beeka gookity woop! 
 A-booriki-booriki-booriki Hoy! 
 He gave her his town house and his racing horses; each meal she ate was a dozen 
 courses. 
 She had a million dollars in nickels and dimes; she sat around and counted it 
 all, a million times. 
 Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi 
 Ho-oh-whoaa-oh-oh-whoa 
 He-de-he-de-hee-de-hee 
 Poor Min! Poor Min! Poo-oor Min </font></pre>
