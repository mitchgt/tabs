<p>Your breath is rank <br>
Your eyes are crossed <br>
and there&#146;s green stuff on your nose<br>
Your hair&#146;s a mess<br>
Your make-up&#146;s run<br>
And there&#146;s puke upon your clothes<br>
But I&#146;m staring at you, dribbling<br>
And my eye can&#146;t help but wink<br>
Cos you&#146;re looking more goddamn horny<br>
With every drop I drink<br>
<br>
One More Pint of Lager for the road<br>
One More shot of Whiskey &#145;fore I go<br>
Do a harmonica solo<br>
<br>
Your daddy he&#146;s my bez mate<br>
He let me scrounge a tab<br>
His body trembles as he calls out<br>
For another shish kebab<br>
As I pissed in his neighbour&#146;s doorway<br>
He was screaming at the moon<br>
So I punched him in the face<br>
And ran off laughing like a loon<br>
<br>
One more pint of lager through my lips<br>
One more shot of whiskey &#145;fore I slip<br>
Into a coma<br>
<br>
Your sister&#146;s got no future<br>
She&#146;s sixteen and on the shelf<br>
I&#146;d show her what a real man is<br>
But this beer won&#146;t drink itself<br>
And that bastard standing at the bar<br>
Keeps on begging for a scrap<br>
I&#146;d glass him in a minute<br>
But my legs have turned to crap<br>
<br>
One more pint of lager for the road<br>
One more quart of bourbon &#145;fore I go<br>
Back on stage</p>
