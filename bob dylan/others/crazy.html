<h1>Crazy</h1>
<p>Willie Nelson<br>
as sung on the <i>VH1 Storytellers</i> album with Johnny Cash (released 1998)<BR>
Tabbed by Eyolf &Oslash;strem</p><HR><BR>

This version is full of Willie's loose licks and tricks, bass runs and chord passages, anything I ever found charming about his playing style. One reviewer thought that "Willie gets a little too fancy with his guitar pickin' " here. Well, OK, perhaps, but what's wrong with a little fancy?  
<pre>
Chords:

C#m7-5    x4200x
G+/d#     xx1003
C/g       335553 (at "new")
Abm6      486444 (yes, it's a stretch ...)
Gm6       375333 (this one too)
Eo        xx2323 - xx5656 - xx8989   (the chord is moved up in three steps)<P></PRE>
The Em (at "wanted") is really nothing more than a quick -2h3p2- on the fourth string, but harmonically some sort of Em is implied.<P> </P>
