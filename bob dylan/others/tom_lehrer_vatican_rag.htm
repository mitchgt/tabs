<pre>Vatican Rag</pre>
<pre>G7
First you get down on your knees,
C
Fiddle with your rosaries,
G7
Bow your head with great respect,
   C    C#o        Dm         G  
And genuflect, genuflect, genuflect!
G7
Do whatever steps you want if
C
You have cleared them with the Pontiff.
F7        F#o
Everybody say his own
C      A
Kyrie eleison,
D7        G7      C
Doin' the Vatican Rag.

G7
Get in line in that processional,
C7
Step into that small confessional.
G7
There the guy who's got religion'll
C7
Tell you if your sin's original.
F
If it is, try playin' it safer,
Fm6
Drink the wine and chew the wafer,
D#o
Two, four, six, eight,
Time to transubstantiate!

So get down upon your knees,
Fiddle with your rosaries,
Bow your head with great respect,
And genuflect, genuflect, genuflect!

Make a cross on your abdomen,
When in Rome do like a Roman;
Ave Maria,
Gee, it's good to see ya.
Gettin' ecstatic an' sorta dramatic an'
Doin' the Vatican
Rag!
