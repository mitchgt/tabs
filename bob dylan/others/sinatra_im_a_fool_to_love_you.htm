<pre>      A+      Dm
I'm a fool to want you
      D7-9    Gm       Gm7 Gm6  
I'm a fool to want you
          Bb/d  F6/c            Bm7-5
To want a love    that can't be true
              Bb7              A
A love that's there for others too

I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you              
To seek a kiss not mine alone
           Dm/a     A7-9      Dm
To share a kiss the devil has known
</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Gm  Gmmaj7 Gm7   Gm6
Time   and time again 
G7-9       Fmaj7      (F7 F6)
I said I'd leave you
Gm  Gmmaj7 Gm7   Gm6
Time   and time again 
  C7-9  Fmaj7
I went away
    Em7-5               A7-9sus4 A7
But then would come the time 
             Dm          Dm7/c
When I would need you
    Bdim                              A7-9sus4   A7
And once again these words I' have to say</pre>

<pre>
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
             Bb7
But right or wrong 
             A7       A7 Bb7  C7  Em7-5  A7-9
I can't get along
        Dm
Without you</pre>
