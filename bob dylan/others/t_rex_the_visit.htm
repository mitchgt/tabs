<pre>   E
My eyes went up  	
        A
It was sunrise  
    E          G
The sky turned black  
         Am
It was noon  
  E
A ship of the silverest  
 A
Metal  
E
Shadowed out  
G           Am
All of the moon  

D7              Em
Truly I do love you-oo  
D7              Em
Truly I do love you-oo  

A shape  
That was golden and crimson  
Extended a claw  
To my frame  
I sunk in the sand  
Like an infant  
I screamed  
but my tongue was lame  

Truly I do love you-oo  
Truly I do love you-oo  

My heart on a platter  
They'd stolen  
My eyes  
Were all fiery flame  
A sound like a sweet dove  
I did Stutter  
And then the ship  
Swum the skies again  </pre>
