<h1>Walk Around Heaven All Day</h1>

</b>Sung by Carolyn Dennis during the 1980-81 part of the Gospel tours<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Sung with piano accompaniement only. On a guitar it is most comfortably played with a
capo on the 3rd fret.<br>
And don't try the high Eb at the end of the bridge unless you're a (very) high soprano...</p>

Oh, my mother will be waiting, and my father too

And everyday will be Sunday, yes it will, Oh, the sabbath will have no end,
We're going to do nothing in Heaven, 
	We're going to do nothing there, but sing God's praises
And I'm just gonna hear and sing sabbath, sabbath, saying well done
'cause my race down here, my race will be won, 
and I'm going to walk around, walk around Heaven
