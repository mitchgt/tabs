<pre>Am                          F          G
 Even the little girls have caught the disease 
Am                           F         G        A
 Even the little girls bring grown men to their knees 
                               D      E    Am
Walkin' down the street you're like a mannequin 
Am                            F    G   A
 Leafin' through the pages of Cosmopolitan </pre>

 In the city of models

 Strip shows and one night stands

 City of models

 City of perfect tans </pre>

<pre>You're invisible So it's okay to stare 
Impossibly high asses Float nine feet in the air 
Every step is hot The sand is neon blue 
Wish you were here So you could be beautiful too </pre>

    <pre>         Dm 
It's all right 
     A                        B 
Everybody and their brother tonight 
         Bm 
Gonna be lookin' at each other 
             E 
Look at each other </pre>

<pre>Into skirts and pants The long, long legs are poured 
Inside of halter tops The big, soft things are stored 
Someone's sleeping By the sidewalk grocery store 
Get me out of here I can't take anymore </pre>

Strip shows and one night stands
