Come my love let's take a walk
       G7           C
Just a little ways away
         C                F
while we walk along we'll talk
      C        G       C
Talk about our wedding day</pre>

<pre>
I drew my knife across her throat
And to my breast she gently pressed 
Oh please oh please don't murder me
for I'm unprepared to die you see</pre>

<pre>I takin' her 'bout her lily white hand
I led her down in the banks of sand
There I plunged her in to drown
And watched her as she floated down

Returning home 'tween twelve and one
Thinkin' of the deed I done
I murdered the girl I loved, you see,
'cause she would not marry me.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Only say that you'll be mine
and in our home we'll happy be
down beside where the waters flow
Down on the banks of the Ohio</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Next day as I's returning home
I met the [...?] in the door
He said: &quot;Young man come with me and go
Down to the banks of the Ohio.&quot;</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Only say that you'll be mine
and in our home we'll happy be
down beside where the waters flow
Down on the banks of the Ohio</pre>
