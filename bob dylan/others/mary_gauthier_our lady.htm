<p>Our lady of the shooting star</p>

<pre>Em
 Our lady of the shooting star
G
was that you last night?
D
 Did we dance our whispered waltz?
      Em
Did I hold you in my sight?</pre>

<pre>When morning came with open arms
she lifted you for me
The sunlight burned my eyes away
and now I cannot see</pre>

<pre>Our lady of the shooting star
as I faced the early light
all that I can think of now
is joining you in flight</pre>

<pre>But I have followed gypsies, girl
I've lost my way back home
I've held the phoenix to my chest
and ended up alone</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Our lady of the shooting star
teach me how to know
I wanna feel my thoughts go dark
And rest inside your flow</pre>

<pre>I'll be awaking without fear
and breathe the cool, clean air
with your words upon my lips
Your will becomes my prayer</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Our lady of the shooting star
look what you have done
you've led me to the waters
that's running from the sun</pre>

<pre>Are you in the briny mist?
Do seagulls scream your name?
They wake, suspended by your love
or do I reach for you in vain?</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>If I move to you, will you move to me?
If I move to you, will you move to me?</pre>
</blockquote>
