</b></font>I took you home from a party and we kissed in fun
  E                        A    Asus4 A
A few stolen kisses and no harm was   done
           D                                    A
Instead of stopping when we could we went right on
                 (A/c#)         D           A/c#
Till suddenly we found that the brakes were gone.</pre>

<pre>You belong to someone else, and I do too
It's just crazy bein' here with you
As a bad motorcycle with the devil in the seat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.

I didn't want to want you, but now I have no choice
It's too late to listen to that warning voice
All I hear is thunder of two hearts beat
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>D
You're not free to belong to me
                           A
And you know I could never be your own
     D  
Your lips on mine are like a sweet, sweet wine
                  A             E
But we're heading for a wall of stone.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Warning signs are flashing ev'ry where, but we pay no heed
'Stead of slowing down the place, we keep a pickin' up speed
Disaster's getting closer ev'ry time we meet
Going ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Yeah, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street
Well, ninety miles an hour down a dead end street.
