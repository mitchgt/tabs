I wandered again to my home in the mountain
                                            B     B7
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free
                E             
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
                      B                 E
I found they were all rank strangers to me.

Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
                                      B     B7
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
                 E       
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
                      B                 E
I found they were all rank strangers to me.</pre>

<pre>
&quot;They all moved a way,&quot; said a voice of a stranger
&quot;To that bautiful home by the bright crystal sea&quot;
Some beautiful day I'll meet 'em in heaven
Where no one will be a stranger to me.

Ev'rybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me.</pre>
