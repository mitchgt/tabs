<pre>A       (A7)</pre>

<pre>Look who's back in town

Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown
D7        
All you boys better run for cover
       E                    
If you don't a-wanna be a broken hearted lover.</pre>

<pre>A
See her in that very tight skirt

Got what it takes just to make you hurt
D7
Don't be deceived by those big bright eyes 
          E
Prefer to treat her nasty and low down lies.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>D
Makes no difference where she's been
A
I know Sal's been doin' them things again
D
Breaking hearts up and down the line
    E
Like she broke this heart of mine.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>A
I'll go see them come down my way

Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:
      D7
&quot;I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
E                                              A
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down&quot;.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <div align="left"><pre>Makes no difference where she's been
I'm go in south and doin' them things again
Bake in a hot tub, down the line
I'd rather see you ruin this a-heart of mine.
</pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<pre>I'll go see them come down my way
Like a fool you're gonna hear me say:
&quot;I'll lay at your bed Sally Sue Brown
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down&quot;.</pre>
