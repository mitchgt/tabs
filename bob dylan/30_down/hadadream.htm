</font>I got to see you baby, I don't care

It may be some place, baby, you say you where
        F#m              D      A
I had a dream about you, baby
  F#m              D     A
A dream about you, baby
F#m                        D                 A
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.

You got the crazy rhythm when you walk
You make me nervous when you start to talk
I had a dream about you, baby
A dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.</pre>

<pre>Standin' on the highway, you flag me down
Said, take me, daddy, to the nearest town
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <div align="left"><pre>D
The join is jumpin' it's really somethin'
A
The beat is pumpin, my heart is thumpin'
B
Spent my money on you honey
   E
My limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin'</pre>
  </div>
</blockquote>

<pre>You kiss me, baby, in the coffee stop
You made me so bad, you gotta stop
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>The join is jumpin' it's really somethin'
The beat is pumpin, my heart is thumpin'
Spent my money on you honey
My limbs are shakin, my heart is breakin'</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>You had a white rag wrapped around your head
Wearing a long dress fire engine red
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rollin' across my mind.
