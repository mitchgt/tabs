<pre>    G                     C/g  G
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
     C/g               G
Look away, you rollin' river
    C/g                   G
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
     G           C/g    G 
Look away, we're bound away
 G/b       C    /b /a G
Across the wide Missouri.

Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rollin' river
Indians camp along her border
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rollin' river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rollin' river
It was for her I'd cross the water
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rollin' river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.

Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you
Look away, you rollin' river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri.
