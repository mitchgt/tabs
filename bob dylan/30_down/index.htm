    <h3>Eyolf Østrem</h3>
    <p><em>Down in the Groove </em>came at a time when Dylan wasn't exactly at the zenith of
    his powers as a recording artist. His struggles with the modern recording techniques (at
    the time mostly resulting in lost battles), as well as a steadily decreasing audience
    since his religious trilogy, hadn't been good for his reputation. And <em>Down in the
    Groove </em>didn't make things much better.</p>
    <p>It is probably one of the last albums people buy. And in my most critical moments I'm
    inclined to say: &quot;And for good reason.&quot; But still: the album has qualities, not
    only compared with <em>Knocked out Loaded</em>, which only has <em>one</em> quality
    (&quot;Brownsville Girl&quot;). </p>
    <p>I'll return to the qualities in a moment. First a general overview: The six first
    songs, and eight out of ten songs on the album as a whole, are in the key of A major, most
    of them are fairly standard 12-bar blues, with slight variations (such as the F#m in <a href="hadadream.htm">Had a Dream About You Baby</a>, which in this case is counterbalanced
    by the rather monotonous singing)(I didn't say it was bad, though). The main difference
    between <a href="lets_stick_together.htm">Let's Stick Together</a>, <a href="sallysue.htm">Sally
    Sue Brown</a>, <a href="hadadream.htm">Had A Dream About You Baby</a> and <a href="ugliest.htm">Ugliest Girl In The World</a> is the titles.</p>
    <p><a href="deathis.htm">Death is Not the End</a> is, I think, the only Dylan song that
    has left a really bad taste in my mouth. It was a general joking subject around here,
    until someone wanted to borrow the album to play this song in his wife's funeral. They had
    heard it on the radio a few days before she died, probably the only time it was ever
    played on the radio. I pass her gravestone every day on my way to work. It hasn't changed
    my opinion about the song, I just don't laugh about it anymore.</p>
    <p><a href="silvio.htm">Silvio</a> is a strange song in many ways. The lyrics by Grateful
    Dead-lyricist Robert Hunter are often referred to as typical Dylan-wannabe-writing. Be
    that as it may--on this album it compares favourably not only to the non-Dylan songs. For
    a very long time it was the regular ending of the first electric set of just about every
    show, which added to its strangeness: a song that for tape-collectors was a nuisance and a
    drag, as the eternal song no. 5, but which most others had never heard--who had got <em>Down
    in the Groove</em> apart from the collectors (the song request of all times: in Stockholm,
    June 9 1998 someone yelled out &quot;SILVIO&quot; after song nr. 4)? </p>
    <p>Musically it is a carbon copy of <em>Isis</em>. That's perhaps not where the real
    genious of <em>Isis</em> lies, but it's a persistent little bugger of a riff.</p>
    <p>The songs that are neither square rock'n'roll in A or &quot;Death is not the end&quot;,
    go to the other opposite--three of them are played in a very loose rhythm (<a href="whendid.htm">When Did You Leave Heaven?</a>, <a href="shenando.htm">Shenandoah</a>, <a href="ninetymiles.htm">Ninety Miles an Hour</a>). These are not only standing out, they
    are really outstanding. Sure enough, the drumming on &quot;When did you leave heaven&quot;
    is a bit strange, but that's forgiveable. &quot;Ninety miles&quot; is a perfect example of
    how to create an intensive pulse (quite fitting the lyrics) without a drum or even a fixed
    rhythm.</p>
    <p>One song left, one performance, and what a performance! <a href="rank_strangers.htm">Rank
    Strangers To Me</a> is one of the reasons to have this one on CD--not because of the
    sound, but because of the repeat button.</td>
