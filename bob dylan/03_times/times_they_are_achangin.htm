<pre>     G             Em
Come gather 'round people
    C        G
Wherever you roam
      G            Em
And admit that the waters
 C              D
Around you have grown
      G            Em
And accept it that soon
          C               G
You'll be drenched to the bone.
        G       Am           D
If your time to you Is worth savin'
         D            D2/c
Then you better start swimmin'
          G/b         D/a
Or you'll sink like a stone
        G     C *)       D   G . .            *) Not played in the first verse
For the times they are a-changin'.</pre>

<pre>G . . | Em . . | C . . | G . . | . . . | . . . | . . .

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'.
'Cause the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows *)
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.</pre>

<h3>Alternate studio version (Oct 1963)</h3>

<p>Released as a bonus track on the limited edition of <em>&quot;Love and Theft&quot;
(2001).<br>
</em>This version combines two well-known Dylan features, the G-G6-G7 figure and the high
capo position, in a song that's usually played in G.</p>

<p>Capo 5th fret (sounding key F major)</p>

<p>The &quot;G-G6-G7&quot; figure in its two versions:</p>

<h3><a name="1981">Live version from Drammenshallen, July 10, 1981</a></h3>
<p>This is a very special version, not only because it was on the first bootleg 
I ever got, or because it was a one-off opener during that tour, or because of 
the delightful error in the second verse, or because it was played not far from 
where I stayed at the time (not that I had the slightest idea, just a kid acting 
smart at the time) - but for all these reasons taken together. </p>
