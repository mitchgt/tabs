<p>&quot;The chords below are what he plays. I'm not sure about the fingering, though. I have a
feeling that it is played in some kind of altered tuning, but I'm not sure yet. The low
g's that are sounding throughout most of the song would indicate an open string. I'm
working on it.&quot; </p>

<p>I wrote that six years ago, and everything up to the last sentence is 
basically true, I think. The last sentence is an outright lie.</p>

<pre>         C                   C/B
Down the street the dogs are barking
         F/A            C/G
And the day is a-getting dark.
       C/G         /F   /E    
As the night comes in a-fallin'
                             G7    C/G'   G7
The dogs, they'll lose their bark.
    C                 C/B
And the silent night will shatter
         F/A               C/G
From the sounds inside my mind
                   /F   /E
And I'm one too many mornings 
      G7       C/G  G7 C
And a thousand miles behind.</pre>

<pre>From the crossroads of my doorstep,
My eyes start to fade.
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid.
And I gaze back to the street
the sidewalk and the sign.
And I'm one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.

It's a restless, hungry feeling
That don't mean no one no good.
When everything I'm saying, 
You can say it just as good.
You are right from your side,
And I am right from mine.
We're both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind.</pre>

<p>Additional last half-verse (the first part of the verse instrumental):</p>

<pre>I've no right to be here

<hr>

<p>*) Play the Bm with the first string open, or as xx4030 - that will imitate <em>some </em>of
the delightful clashes that only a full, desperate Rolling Thunder band can produce.</p>
