<h1>Ragged &amp; Dirty</h1>

<p>Written by Yank Rachell and Sleepy John Estes<br>
arranged by Bob Dylan and played on <a href="index.htm"><em>World Gone Wrong</em></a>
(1993)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 4th fret (original key E major)</p>

<p>The trick is to get the riff that runs through the whole song right. This riff appears
everywhere where there's a G, and it's always played twice in a row. The adjacent open
strings <em>should</em> be sounding, especially at the end of the riff, where you get the
delicious clash between the Bb of the third string and the B of the open second string.
The : and | indicate the beats. Most of the melody notes come a little before the beat,
and should be played on the upstrokes. Throughout all of this, you keep strumming, but
lightly, mainly to indicate the basic rhythm. <br>
For the initial slide up ( / = slide up), you already have the index finger in place from
the C chord. Use that.</p>

<p>u=up, d=down </p>

<p>Lord, I went to my window, babe, I couldn't see through my blinds<br>
Went to my window, babe I couldn't see through my blinds<br>
Heard my best friend coming around I thought I heard my baby cry.<br>
<br>
Lord, if I can't come in here, baby then just let me sit down in your door<br>
If I can't come in here baby then just let me sit down in your door<br>
And I would leave so soon that your man won't never know.<br>
<br>
How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease ?<br>
How can I live here baby, Lord, and feel at ease ?<br>
Well, that woman I got, man, she do just what she feels.<br>
<br>
Lord you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild<br>
Shouldn't mistreat me, baby, because I'm young and wild<br>
You must always remember, baby, you was once a child.<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blind<br>
Leaving in the morning, if I have to ride the blinds<br>
Well, I've been mistreated and I swear, I don't mind dyin'.</p>
