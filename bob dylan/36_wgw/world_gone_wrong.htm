<h1>World Gone Wrong</h1>

<p>Trad., arranged by Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">World Gone Wrong</a> </em>(1993)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 2nd fret (Original key D major) </p>

<p>Chords: </p>

<pre>C       x32010
Csus4   x33010
C+      x32110
Cmaj7   xx5500 (that's what he seems to be playing anyway. 
               Otherwise it is usually played x32000) </pre>

<p>The last line in every verse is given special treatment every time. Sometimes he plays
C F G C using only the strings 2, 3 and 4. Other times he goes straight to an F after the
Cmaj7. It's all mainly a flourish anyway, so... And the riff that follows is just as
variable. This is basically what he plays:</p>

Strange things have happened like never before

My baby told me I would have to go
  C+       F                  *      F
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
           G          
I can't be good, baby 
Cmaj7                    C    F    G    C
Honey, because the world gone wrong.</pre>

<pre>[Riff 1]</pre>

<p>Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home<br>
No use in worrying cause the world gone wrong<br>
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br>
I can't be good baby <br>
Honey, because the world gone wrong.<br>
<br>

If I didn't leave you, I would have to kill you dead<br>
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br>
I can't be good baby <br>
Honey, cause the world gone wrong.<br>
<br>
I tried to be lovin', and treat you kind<br>
But it seem like you never right, you got no loyal mind<br>
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br>
I can't be good baby <br>
Honey, cause the world's gone wrong.<br>

If you had a woman and she don't treat you kind<br>
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind<br>

Just tell her kindly, þThere is the front doorþ<br>
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br>
I can't be good baby<br>
Honey, because the world's gone wrong.<br>
<br>
Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat<br>
No use to ask me baby, cause I'll never be back<br>
I can't be good no more, once, like I did before<br>
I can't be good baby. <br>
Honey, because the world gone wrong.</p>
