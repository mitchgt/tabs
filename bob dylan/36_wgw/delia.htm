<p>It should be mentioned that Dylan isn't always dead certain about neither how long to
strum F before &quot;all the friends I ever had are gone&quot;, nor about now to play the
descending riff. But hey, he's an artist, man, you gotta give him that.</p>

    All the friends I ever had are gone.
</pre>

<pre>Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West
When she returned, little Delia'd gone to rest.
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>Delia's Daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>Curtis's looking high, Curtis's looking low
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>High upon the housetops, high as I can see
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.
All the friends I ever had are gone</pre>

<pre>Men in Atlanta, trying to pass for white
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>Judge says to Curtis, &quot;What's this noise about?&quot;
&quot;All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out.&quot;
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>Curtis said to the judge &quot;What might be my fine?&quot;
Judge says, &quot;Poor boy, you got ninety-nine.&quot;
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>Curtis' in the jailhouse, drinking from an old tin cup
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up. 
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>

<pre>Delia, oh Delia, how could it be?
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.
All the friends I ever had are gone.</pre>
