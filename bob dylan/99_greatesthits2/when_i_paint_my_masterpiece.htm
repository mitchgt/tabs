<h1>When I Paint My Masterpiece</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded March 1971 and released on <em><a href="index.htm">Greatest Hits, vol 2</a> </em>(1971)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The nice figures A -D/a - A and D/a - A/e - E work well on a piano, but on a guitar
they are much more easily produced in G (capo 2nd fret), where the ensuing G/d could be
played xx0433 (to set it off as something different from plain G).</p>

<p>The last verse doesn't work very well in either version.</p>

<pre>                   A        D/a         A
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble,
(D/a)   A/e      E              A    
Ancient footprints are everywhere.
D/a        A                        D/a    A
   You can almost think that you're seein' double
(D/a) A/e        E                    A
On a  cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs.
E                          D     A
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room,
           E                       D       A
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece.
D/a      A                   D/a            A
Yup, she promised that she'd be right there with me
(D/a)  A/e E          A        D/a A
When I paint my masterpiece.</pre>

<pre>
Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Coliseum,
Dodging lions and wastin' time.
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see 'em,
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb.
Train wheels runnin' through the back of my memory,
as the daylight hours do increase
Someday, everything is gonna be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece.</pre>

I left Rome and landed in Brussels,
       Bb/f                  F           Bb     
With a picture of a tall oak tree by my side.
Bb                             Eb/bb         Bb
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pullin' muscles,
Bb/f                   F               Bb   
Everyone was there and nobody tried to hide.
F                   Bb
Newspapermen eating candy
F                      Eb    Bb
Had to be held down by big police.
Bb                     Eb/bb    Bb
Someday, everything is gonna be diff'rent
       Bb/f F         Bb
