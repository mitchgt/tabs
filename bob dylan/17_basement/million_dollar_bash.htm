<h1>Million Dollar Bash</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">The Basement Tapes</a> </em>(1967/1975) and on <a
href="../28_biograph/index.htm"><em>Biograph</em></a> (1985)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 4th fret (sounding key E major)</p>

<p>G6 (320000) is a suggestion for the last G in the chorus. It could be that he's playing
320010, i.e. a mix between G and C.<br>
Some of the F's seem to be played Fmaj7 (x33210)</p>

Well, that big dumb blonde
         F
With her wheel of gorge
    C
And Turtle, that friend of theirs
         G
With his checks all forged
        C
And his cheeks in a chunk
         F
With his cheese in the cash
        C
They're all gonna be there
        G              C
At that million dollar bash
Am         F   C
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Am         F   C
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
          G6             C
It's that million dollar bash

Ev'rybody from right now
To over there and back
The louder they come
The bigger they crack
Come now, sweet cream
Don't forget to flash
We're all gonna meet
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I took my counselor
Out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there
She told him to yarn
along came Jones
Emptied the trash
Ev'rybody went down
To that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I'm hittin' it too hard
My stones won't take
I get up in the mornin'
But it's too early to wake
First it's hello, goodbye
Then push and then crash
But we're all gonna make it
At that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash

Well, I looked at my watch
I looked at my wrist
I punched myself in the face
With my fist
I took my potatoes
Down to be mashed
Then I made it on over
To that million dollar bash
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
Ooh, baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash</pre>
