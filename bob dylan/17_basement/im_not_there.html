<hr>

<pre>G
Everything is alright

and then she's all the time
      F
in my neighbourhood.
     Am
She cries both day and night.
  G
I know it 'cos I was there.

It's a milestone
          F
but she's down on her luck.
        Am
And the day makes her lonely
         G
and it's so hard to buck,

I was there.
</pre>

<ul>
  <pre>    C
I believe that she'd stop him
       Em
if she would start to care.
  F
I believe that she'd look upon 
     C
this side and to care 
        Em
and I'd go by the [...]
           F   
when she's on my way,
      G
but I don't belong there.
</pre>
</ul>

<pre>
No I don't belong to her,
I don't belong to anybody
She's my prize forsaken angel
but she don't care, she cries.
She's a lone-hearted mystic
and she can carry on
When I'm there she's alright,
but she's not when I'm gone.</pre>

<ul>
  <pre>Heaven knows that the answer,
she's don't call in no one.
She's away, that sailing beauty,
but she's mine for the one.
And I'm also hesitating
by temptation as it runs.
But she don't follow me (holler me?)
but I'm not there, I'm gone.</pre>
</ul>

<pre>Now I'll cry tonight
like I cried the night before.
And I'll feast on her eyes
but I'll dream about the door.
So long Jesus, savior,
blind faith worth to tell
It don't have consolation,
she's my own fare thee well</pre>

<ul>
  <pre>[...]
I was born to love her
but she knows that the kingdom
waits so high above her,
And I don't run but I race
but it's not too fast a pace.
Of course I'll not deceive her.
I'm not there, I'm gone</pre>
</ul>

<pre>Well it's all about confusion
that I cry for her.
I don't mean
beside me to tell.
And it's all information
I will see
[...]
[...]
but she don't 
[...]</pre>

<ul>
  <pre>Yes she's gone like the rain
that's shining yesterday,
and I'd like
singing beauty
and she don't trust anyone,
and I wished I was beside her,
but I'm not there, I'm gone.</pre>
</ul>

<pre>Well it's too hard to
and I don't bother me,
it's all
too hard to leave.
It's a crime the way
she moved me around.
[...]
[...]</pre>

<ul>
  <pre>Yes I believe that it's rightful,
I believe in my mind,
I've been told like I said before
carried the grind.
When she's all
liike I said carry on.
I wish I was there to help her,
but I'm not there, I'm gone.</pre>
</ul>
