<pre>   C                   G
To love you still, and have you not
     C          F       C
Will destroy me   in time
       C                        G
So I'm goin' away, where nobody knows me
    C       F           C
And get you   off my mind</pre>

  <pre>     F                  C 
I've packed my things a dozen times
      G             C    C7
But unpack is all I do
        F                  C
Yes I'm still in town, I'm still around
    G                  C
And still in love with you

  F              C
I made it to the edge of town,
G           C
But turned around
  F              C
I made it to the bridge downtown
       D7*)         G                *) Mistakenly played 
But my nerve let me down                G the first time</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I try to go, but how can I leave
When all roads lead to you
(Yes) I'm still in town, still around
And still in love with you</pre>
