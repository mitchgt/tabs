<h1>I'm Your Teenage Prayer</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan (I presume)<br>
Sung (if that's what it's called) by Dylan and the Band in the <a href="index.htm">Basement</a>,
1967<br>
Tabbed and transcribed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 2nd fret (sounding key D major)</p>

<p>Words in parentheses ( ) are the mostly spoken interjections of the Band (is it Richard
Manuel?).<br>
Words in brackets [ ] are Dylan's spoken words.<br>
I haven't written out the laughter, because it's all over the place.</p>
