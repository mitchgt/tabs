<h1>All You Have To Do Is Dream</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan, I guess<br>
Performed by Bob Dylan and the Band in the <a href="index.htm">Basement</a>, summer 1967<br>
Tabbed by Simon Bedford and Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>There were two takes, and since they are virutally identical, I'll present both...</p>

<p>The chords are written as if played with a capo on the 1st or the 3rd fret (for the two
takes). On the recordings the guitar part is played with barre chords higher up on the
neck.</p>

<pre>       G      Am     Bm    Am 
If the farmer has no silo
        G         Am      Bm    Am 
And his fuel cost runs up high
G                     Am           Bm       Am 
Well, that's just how much I would love you
   G          Am          Bm    Am 
if you'd just only let me try</pre>

  <pre>C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am
in some nice young up-to-date kitchen
C                     Am
let us get aquainted, dear
         G&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Bm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am
and them old floor-birds would just quit eatin'
         C         D         G
And just grin from ear to&nbsp;ear

<pre>Two floor birds and a prudent baby chick, yes that's me 
That ain't much to bust
But restriction causes damage
And damage causes lust</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>So, poor little girl, come blow this horn
Hard as any horn might seem
It's very easily done, actually
All you have to do is dream.</pre>
  <pre>[instrumental verse]</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Well, the whole back-strappers are a dime a dozen
And I can get a cup for a nickle
Yes, but look what an earful I get and it's all awful too
Everytime I try to go get me a little tickle</pre>

<pre>So, give me one sweet loaf of bread
just one sweet loaf, I'll fill it up and I'll be gone
Yes, just like some of these old floor birds
who fly from dawn to dawn
who fly from dawn to dawn
who fly from dawn to dawn
who fly from dawn to dawn</pre>
