<h1>Bonnie Ship the Diamond</h1>

<p>Trad.<br>
Played by Bob Dylan and the Band in the <a href="index.htm">Basement</a> of 1967<br>
Lyrics modified from <a
href="http://www.maths.univ-rennes1.fr/~dmartin/Dylan/html/songs/B.html">It's not a house
it's a home page</a>. Chords tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>On my copy it plays in Bbm, thus a capo on the 1st fret.<br>
The chords in the first verse aren't quite like in the rest of the verses, which follow
the simpler pattern of the second verse.</p>

<pre>Am</pre>

<pre>          Am     C/g        D/f#     
Well, the bonnie ship was a good old ship
          Am                      E
She was a-fishin' on a [leading chain]
    Am     /c            C/g        
And me an' John oh was a long catch[-on?]
           D/f#        F   E     Am
It was the last of the ones I've seen </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>        Am          G       Am
So with sword and a rope in bay
                            E
Feel all that your heart be sailed
          Am     C/g      D/f#
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
Am      Em      Am
fishin' for the whales.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>         Am                  D
Well, we feud all night, the cabin gauge,
         Am                E
It was a-more than feelin' bad
         Am                  D
And with all kind friends we watched in fear
         Am             Em   Am
It was a naught time we ever had.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>        Am   D     Am
So it's rise up my lads
                      E
Let your hearts never fail
          Am     C/g      D/f# 
When that bonnie ship the Diamond goes
F       E       Am
fishin' for the whales.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>An' all day long at Vera Cruz
We sailed [all the likes] to bind
With no heavy moan, any hearts [of stone]
No aid was cried [tried?] for mine.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>So it's cheer up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond
Goes fishin' for the whales.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Well, now along Cape Fate, 'twas lit in red
All along cape Horn
And from Vera Cruz we sailed ahead
It was all in the time of storm.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>So, it's cheer on up my boys
Let your hearts never fail
When that bonnie ship the Diamond
Goes fishin' for the whales. </pre>
