<h1>People Get Ready</h1>

<p>By Curtis Mayfield<br>
Played by Bob Dylan during <a href="index.htm"><em>The Basement Tapes</em></a> sessions
(1967), and released on the promo EP for <em>Renaldo and Clara </em>(1976/78)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<h3>Renaldo and Clara version</h3>

<p>Same chord progression repeated throughout. The lyrics aren't always decipherable,
mainly because Dylan doesn't quite remember them. Which makes this a wonderful proof of
his ability to improvise on the spot.</p>

<pre>Bb         Gm               Eb      Bb
People get ready, there's a train a comin'
picking up passengers coast to coast
All you need is faith to hear the diesels a-hummin'
[...] among the loved the most.</pre>

<pre>People get ready for that train to Jordan
picking up passengers [...]
All you need is faith to hear those diesels a-hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord</pre>

<pre>There ain't no room&nbsp;for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances get slimmer
For there's no hiding place among the Kingdom's throne</pre>

<pre>So people get ready, there's a train a-comin'
don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels a-hummin'
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord</pre>

<pre>[D: &quot;remember this one&quot;]</pre>

Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's hope for all among those loved the most.</pre>

You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels hummin'
