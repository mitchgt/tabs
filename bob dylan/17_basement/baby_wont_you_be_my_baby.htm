<pre>        Bb         
Well, I looked as far as I could see, baby
                                F
I looked as far as I could see, baby
        Bb
Well, I looked as far as I could see, 
Eb
All mankind in misery, 
Bb    F               Bb
Baby, won't you be my baby?
</pre>

<pre>Well, I looked east, I looked west, baby
I looked east, I looked west, baby
Well, I looked east, I looked west
There was nothing I could see that I liked the best
Baby, won't you be my baby?</pre>

<pre>[Go down the land], drop your heavy load, baby
Go down the land, drop your load, baby
Go down the land, drop your load,
Just don't look back, it's a dead end road
Baby, won't you be my baby?</pre>

<pre>Now east and west the fire will rise, baby
east and west the fire will rise, baby
east and west the fire will rise
Shut your mouth, close your eyes, 
Baby, won't you be my baby?</pre>

<pre>Oh, [I been off] savin' your time, baby
I ain't tryin' to mess, I'll just save your time, baby    
I ain't tryin' to mess, just save your time, 
but it's your life, it's not mine
Baby, won't you be my baby?</pre>
