<h1>Try Me</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded by Bob Dylan and The Band in the Basement, Summer 1967<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>I warn you: after the two first lines, the lyrics don't make any sense at all. The only
reason I've bothered tabbing this, is that the tune is interesting. </p>

<p>Capo 3rd (or 2nd) fret</p>
