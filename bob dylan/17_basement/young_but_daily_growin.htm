<pre>Ah, one day as I was walking all alone down by the schoolwall
I saw the boys, they were playing at the ball
And my own true love was the fairest of them all
He was young, but he was daily growin'.</pre>

<pre>At the age of sixteen years he was a married man
at the age of seventeen he was the father of a son
At the age of eighteen years, 'round his grave the grass grew long
Cruel death had put an end to his growin'</pre>

<pre>Oh, the springtime is leavin' now, and summer's comin' on
With ornaments and fans the ladies all pass on
Oh yes, once I had a true love, but now I have none.
But I'll watch his bonnie son, while he's growin.</pre>

And there's many a day that you and I have seen.

<pre>Oh father, dearest father, you've done me great wrong.
You've married me to a boy who is much too young.
Oh I am twice twelve, and he is but fourteen 
He's a bonnie lad, he's young but he's growing. </pre>

<pre>Oh father, dearest father, oh and if it pleases you.
I'll send my man on to a school for a year or two.
And on top of his college cap, he'll wear a ribbon bow
so that the other girls might know that he's married. </pre>

<pre>One day when I was walking all alone down by the schoolwall,
  Em                               C        G      D
I saw the boys were playing at the bouncing of the ball.
And my own true love was the fairest of them all.
He's a bonny lad but he's daily growing. </pre>

<pre>At the age of fourteen he was a married man.
At the age of fifteen the father of a son.
At the age of sixteen on his grave the grass grew green.
Cruel death had put an end to his growing. </pre>

<pre>I'll buy my love a shroud of ornamental ground
and place it on his grave. Oh the tears come trippling down.
For once I had a true love but now I have not.
But I'll watch his bonny son while he's a-growing.<font

<pre>       G               C  G         Em              C     G
Oh the trees they grow tall and the leaves they are green.

And many a-time my true love I've seen.
    G      C  G        Em          C   G
And many a-night how I walked all alone.
     G               Em          D     G
When my Johnny was a long time a-growin'.</pre>
<pre>C   /b /a  G


I remember so well over my father's wall
I heard the boys were singing, I can hear them dancin'-call.
And my own true love was the fairest of them all.
He's young, but he's daily a-growin'.

Oh father, dear father, you've done me great wrong.
You've married me of to a boy that's much too young.
Oh I am twice twelve, and he is but fourteen 
He's young, but he's daily a-growin'.

Oh daughter, dear daughter, I've done you no wrong.
I've married you to a rich man's son.
Oh he will be a lord for you to wait upon.
Yes he's young, but he's daily a-growin'.

At the age of fourteen he was a married man.
At the age of fifteen the father of a son.
At the age of sixteen has a grave, it was green.
And death put a stop to his growin'. 

But he've born me one son, so I can pass the time
Wachin' my boy rised a great a-year.
And I will wachin' rise, 'til he becomes a man.
He's young now, but he's daily a-growin'.</pre>
