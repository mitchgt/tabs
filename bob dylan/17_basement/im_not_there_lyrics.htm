<h2>I'm Not There (1956)</h2>

<p>Transcription by Simon Bedford <br>
<br>
well its alright and then she s all the the time<br>
in my nieghborhood she cried both day and night<br>
i know it cause it was there<br>
<br>
its a milestone but she down on her luck<br>
and she day makes her lonely but to me hard to buck<br>
i believe<br>
<br>
i believe where she stopping where she wants time to care<br>
i believe that shed look upon deciding to care<br>
and i go by the lord in ways shes on my way<br>
but i dont belong there<br>
<br>
no i dont belong to her<br>
i dont belong to anybody<br>
shes my prize foresaken angel but she dont hear me cry<br>
shes a long hearted mistress<br>
and she cant carry on<br>
when im there shes alright but whenshes not when i am gone<br>
<br>
heaven knows that theres an answer<br>
shes not calling noone<br>
shes away sailing beautiful<br>
shes mine for the one<br>
<br>
and i lost her hesitation<br>
by temptation less it runs<br>
but she dont holler me<br>
but im not there i am gone<br>
<br>
now i've cried tonight<br>
like i cried the night before <br>
and i <br>
but i dream about the door<br>
<br>
solong jesus savior<br>
blind faith where the tale?<br>
it dont hang proclamation<br>
shes my own far thee well<br>
<br>
now i went out neath the levee<br>
i was born to love her<br>
but she knows that the kingdom <br>
waits so far above her<br>
<br>
and i run but i race<br>
but its not to fast a slim?<br>
but i ll not decieve her<br>
im not there i am gone<br>
<br>
well its all about confusion as i cry for her viel<br>
i dont need anybody now be side me to tell<br>
and its all information i can see but its not<br>
shes a lone hearted beauty but shes gone like the spot<br>
and she wants<br>
<br>
yes she gone like the rainbow that shining yesterday<br>
but now shes a home beside me and id like tohere her stay<br>
shes a cold forsaken beauty and it dont trust anyone<br>
and i wish i was beside but i am not there i am gone<br>
<br>
well its too hard to stake in<br>
and i dont bother me<br>
its all bad for abusing<br>
but shes hard to hard to leave<br>
<br>
its alone its a crime<br>
the way she wont be around<br>
but she told for to hate me<br>
but this long forsaken clown<br>
<br>
yes i believe that its rightful<br>
oh i believe it in my mind<br>
i been told like i said when i before carry on the crying<br>
and shes all good to told her<br>
like i said carry on<br>
i wish i was there to help<br>
but im not there im gone</p>
