<h3>Take #1</h3>

<p>Capo 2nd fret:</p>

<pre>    D                     G
She laughed each time she called my name
     D           G 
Made promises to meet a...</pre>

<pre>[no, let's, let's put it down in G]</pre>

<p>No capo:</p>

<pre>Am                          C          D
[Three silver rings] ... on slim hands waiting
                G     D/f#       C        Em    D   
Flash bright in candlelight till Sunday's early morn
             Am        C     D 
We found her room that rainy morning
            G            D/f#    C         Em     D
She took my hand through winding roads and led me home</pre>

<pre>
Some red French wine when later wating
In her warm hideaway, she smiled and combed her hair
We talked of all, we talked of nothing
I left with promises to meet; she told me where.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>    D                   G
She laughed each time I asked her name
     D           G
Made promises to meet again
        C            Em     D        G
But her friends down at the French café
       Am                D
Had no English words for me

<pre>So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings ...</pre>

<pre>[sudden stop]</pre>

<pre>So you may find above the border
A girl with silver rings, I never knew her name
You're bound to lose, she's too much for you
She'll leave you lost some rainy morn, you won't be the same</pre>

you won't be the same</pre>
