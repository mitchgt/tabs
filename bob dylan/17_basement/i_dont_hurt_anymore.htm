<pre>[n.c.]          C
I don't hurt anymore
                     G     C/g G
All my teardrops are dry. 
                    D
No more walking the floor 
                    G     C/g G7
With that burning inside. </pre>

<pre>[n.c.]                 C
Just to think it could be 
                    G    C/g G
Time has opened the door 
                 D     
And at last I am free. 
[n.c.]          G     C  G
I don't hurt anymore. </pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>   C     
No use to deny I wanted to die 
                              G       C/g G
The day that you said we were through. 
    A7
But now that I'm fine, you're out of my mind, 
D7 [n.c.]
I can't believe that it's true. </pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I forgot it somehow 
That I cared so before 
And it's wonderful now. 
I don't hurt anymore.</pre>
