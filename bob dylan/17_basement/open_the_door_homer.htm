<h1>Open the Door, Homer</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan <br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">The Basement Tapes</a> </em>(1967/1975)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Capo 3rd fret (sounding key Bb major)</p>

<pre>G</pre>

<pre>               G
Now, there's a certain thing
       Em
That I learned from Jim
G                                   D
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
    G
And that is that there's a certain way
Em  
 we all must swim
        C
If we expect to live off
                  D
Of the fat of the land.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>         Am
Open the door, Rachel [Richard?],

I've heard it said before.

Open the door, Rachel,

I've heard it said before
      C                           G
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>
Now, there's a certain thing
That I learned from my friend, Mouse
A fella who never blushes
And that is that one must always
flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Chorus</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>&quot;Take care of all your memories&quot;
Said Mick
&quot;For you cannot relive them
And remember when you're out there
Tryin' to heal the sick
That you must always
First forgive them.&quot;</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Chorus</pre>
