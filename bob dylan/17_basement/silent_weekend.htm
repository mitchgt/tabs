<h1>Silent Weekend</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded during the <a href="index.htm">Basement Sessions</a> (1967)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>It actually sounds as if Dylan has left his beloved G -C/g-G chord structure here, and
instead plays in A, with a capo on the 1st fret.</p>

Silent weekend,

My baby she gave it to me

Silent weekend,
   A
My baby she gave it to me.
      E7
She's opened every heart
       D7
but at sleep [...] and be part (??)
          A
and she's leavin' me down in misery.

Silent weekend,
My baby she took me by the heart.
Silent weekend,
My baby she took me by the heart.
She's [awake and] bad, she's boastin'
but I know I know she's ghostin' 
An' she's tearin' me all apart.

Silent weekend,
Oh Lord, I wish Monday would come.
Silent weekend,
Oh Lord, I sure wish Monday would come.
She's [open] and she's leavin',
but I hate to sit here grievin'
but I just can't sit here playin' dumb.</pre>

  <pre>               D
Well, I done a whole lotta thinkin' 'bout a whole lot of cheatin',
      A
And I, maybe I did please.
           B7                 
But I just walloped a lotta pizza after makin' our peace,
        Esus4            E
Puts ya down on bended knees.</pre>

<pre>Silent weekend,
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
Silent weekend,
Man alive, I'm burnin' up on my brain.
She knows when I'm just teasin'
But it's not likely in the season
To open up a passenger train.</pre>
