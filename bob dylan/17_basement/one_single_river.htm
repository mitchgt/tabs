<pre>                               E  
How come we can't talk to each other any more?
Am            D7               G
Why can't you see I'm changing too?
G                             E
 We've got by far too long to end it feeling wrong
Am                              D
And I still share too much with you</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>
Em                          D
Just one great river always flowing to the sea
Em                       D
One single river rolling in eternity
G                             E
Two nations in this land that lies along its shore
Am            D             G 
 But just one river rolling free.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>How come you shut me out as if I wasn't there
What's this new bitterness you've found?
However wronged you were, however strong it hurt
It wasn't me who held you down.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>One single river always flowing to the sea
One single river rolling in eternity
Two nations in this land that lies along its shore
But just one river rolling free.</pre>
  <pre>[Instrumental verse + refrain]</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Why can't you understand I'm glad you're standing proud
I know you made it on your own
But in this new pride you've earned, I thought you might have learned
That you don't have to stand alone</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Lonely northern river always flowing to the sea
One single river rolling in eternity
Two nations in this land that lies along its shore
But just one river rolling free.</pre>
