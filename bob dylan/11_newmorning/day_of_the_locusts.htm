Piano song, lots of b's. Best played with a capo on the 1st fret (Original key Ab major). <br>
It's all just one chord sequence that is repeated for each line. </p>

<tt>Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,</tt> <br>
<tt>The birdies were flying from tree to tree.</tt> <br>
<tt>There was little to say, there was no conversation</tt> <br>
<tt>As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.</tt> <br>
&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>
  <tt><p>And the locusts sang off in the distance,</tt> <br>
  <tt>Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.</tt> <br>
  <tt>Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,</tt> <br>
  <tt>Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.</tt></p>
</blockquote>

<p><tt>I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,</tt> <br>
<tt>Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.</tt> <br>
<tt>I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',</tt> <br>
<tt>But the next time I looked there was light in the room.</tt> </p>

<p><tt>Outside ' of the gates the trucks were unloadin',</tt> <br>
<tt>The weather was hot, nearly 90 degrees.</tt> <br>
<tt>The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,</tt> <br>
<tt>Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.</tt> </p>

<p><tt>I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,</tt> <br>
<tt>Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,</tt> <br>
<tt>Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,</tt> <br>
<tt>Sure was glad to get out of there alive.</tt> </p>

<p><tt>And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,</tt> <br>
<tt>Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.</tt> <br>
<tt>And the locusts sang with a high whinin' trill</tt> <br>
<tt>Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me,</tt> </p>
