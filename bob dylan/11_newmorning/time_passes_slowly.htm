Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
D              C           G           Em
 We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
F#m        Em/g             F#m/a             Em/g
 Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream,
D            C                  G         F#m    /a G 
 Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.  </pre>

Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-lookin',
D              C                 G        Em         A
 We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cookin',
G                A(sus4 A) G                  A
 Starin' out the window     to the stars high above,
G           F#m                Asus4         A      
Time passes slowly when you're searchin' for love.</pre>

<pre>[short, glorious piano break]

G                          D
 Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
G                             D
 Ain't no reason to go to the fair.
         G                         D
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Asus4                 A   Asus4    A
 Ain't no reason to go anywhere.</pre>

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
D                  C            G          Em
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right,
Asus4                  G           Asus4         G
  Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day,
Asus4       G          F#m    Em . . . . Asus4 
Time passes slowly and fades away.</pre>
