<h1>The Man In Me</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
(from the album <a href="index.htm"><em>New Morning</em></a><i>,</i> 1970)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<hr>

<p>This is a piano song, and he prefers to play these on the black keys, hence the
original key is Ab major. On a guitar this suggests a capo on the 1st fret, with the
following chords: </p>

<pre>[shamelessly happy &quot;la la la la&quot;s throughout the intro:]</pre>

<pre>G . . . |C /b Am7 . |D . C . |G . . . |
G . . . |C .  .   . |D . . . |G . . . |</pre>

<pre>G                     C      C/B Am
The man in me will do nearly any task,
    D             C                              G               
And as for compensation, there's little he would ask. 
       G           
Take a woman like you 
       C              C/D
To get through to the man in me.</pre>

<pre>Storm clouds are raging all around my door, 
I think to myself I might not take it any more. 
Take a woman like your kind 
To find the man in me.</pre>

<pre>     Am                   G 
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling 
        Am                G
Just to know that you are near, 
Am                 G
Sets my a heart a-reeling 
        Am            D
From my toes up to my ears.</pre>

<pre>The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein' seen, 
But that's just because he doesn't want to turn into some machine. 
Took a woman like you 
To get through to the man in me.</pre>

<pre>G C /B Am  D G
La la la la etc...</pre>

<pre>repeat and fade</pre>

The man in me will do nearly any thing,

<pre>&nbsp;</pre>

<pre>Storms on the river of no return, 
I'd try to teach you how, but I know that you never learn.
Take a woman like your kind 
To find the man in me.</pre>

<blockquote>

<pre>     Bm                   A 
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling 
        Bm                         A
Just to know that you're really there, 
   Bm                  A 
It sets my old heart a-reeling 
Bm               C#m        D          E
 right from my feet to the top of the stairs.</pre>

</blockquote>

<pre>How can you believe it? Well, I guess it's true
I'm lying next to her, baby, but I'm thinking of you
Take a woman like you 
To get through to the man in me.</pre>

<pre>[instrumental verse]</pre>

<blockquote>

<pre>Oh, what a wonderful feeling  
Just to know that you really exist,
It makes my, makes my head go reeling 
All you got to do is look my way, and, baby, I just can't resist</pre>

</blockquote>

<pre>[I] go down to the border beneath the sun
Calling out her name, but, baby, you're the one
Take a woman like you 
To get through to the man in me.
Take a woman like you 
To get through to the man in me.</pre>
