<h1>Sign on the Window</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <em><a href="index.htm">New Morning</a> </em>(1970)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>Piano song - in F# major, possibly the worst conceivable guitar key. I suggest a capo
on the 2nd fret and the following chords:</p>

<pre>Asus2      002200
E/b        x<strong>2</strong>2100
E/a        x<strong>0</strong>2100
E/g#       422100 or 476454
F#m7       242222
F#9        242324
F#m/a      x<strong>0</strong>4222</pre>

Brighton girls are like the moon,

<p>I accidentally tabbed this one with my guitar tuned down one half tone - and that
happens to work quite well. </p>
