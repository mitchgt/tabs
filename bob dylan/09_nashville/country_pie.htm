<h1>Country Pie</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Nashville Skyline</em></a> (1969)<br>

<p>The Bm is usually mixed with a B7 (which means you can pick whichever you want of the
two)</p>

<pre>A    /c#      D
Just like old Saxophone Joe
F#m                        Bm
When he's got the hogshead up on his toe
A  /c#    F#7
Oh me, oh my
Bm        E       A
Love that country pie

Listen to the fiddler play
When he's playin' 'til the break of day
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>C#7
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
F#
  What do I care?
Bm
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
E
Call me for dinner, honey, I'll be there</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>
Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on 'er and turn her loose
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>I don't need much and that ain't no lie
Ain't runnin' any race
Give to me my country pie
I won't throw it up in anybody's face</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Shake me up that old peach tree
Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie</pre>
