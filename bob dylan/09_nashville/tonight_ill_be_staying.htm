Throw my ticket out the window,
G        C                   G
Throw my suitcase out there, too,
         C        G/b     C
Throw my troubles out the door,
        C         G/b Am
I don't need them any more
       G               C                 G
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.

I should have left this town this morning
But it was more than I could do.
Oh, your love comes on so strong
And I've waited all day long
For tonight when I'll be staying here with you.</pre>

  <pre>Cm                   G
Is it really any wonder
Cm                               G
The love that a stranger might receive.
Ab                             C
You cast your spell and I went under,
Am                        D      C  Bm  Am
I find it so difficult to leave.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>
I can hear that whistle blowin',
I see that stationmaster, too,
If there's a poor boy on the street,
Then let him have my seat
'Cause tonight I'll be staying here with you.</pre>

and your love was all that mattered
so tonight I'll be staying here with you, get ready, 
cause tonight I'll be staying here with you</pre>
