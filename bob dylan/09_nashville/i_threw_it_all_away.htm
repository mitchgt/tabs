<pre>
C      Am      F      C
I once held her in my arms,
C                 Am     F    G
She said she would always stay.
A         Dm
But I was cruel,
  C           Em     F
I treated her like a fool,
C  F               C      F
    I threw it all away.

Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.
I must have been mad,
I never knew what I had,
Until I threw it all away.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>F                 G      C                   Am
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
F             G                   A
Love and only love, it can't be denied.
F                  G
No matter what you think about it
C                  Em      Am
 You just won't be able to do without it.
Bb                        F  G
Take a tip from one who's tried.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,
For one thing that's certain,
You will surely be a-hurtin',
If you throw it all away
C      G             C 
If you throw it all away.</pre>
