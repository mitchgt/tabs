<pre>Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you're the best thing that he's ever seen
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile</pre>

You can have your cake and eat it too

When he's standing in front of you</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed

I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead</pre>

<pre>Forget this dance, let's go upstairs!
Let's take a chance, who really cares?
Why don't you know you got nothing to prove
It's all in your eyes and the way that you move
Forget this dance, let's go upstairs!</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Bm                  C                  G
 Why wait any longer for no need to complain (?)
Bm                                G         C/g G   
 You can have love, But you might loose it.
Bm                 C                         G
 Why run any longer When you're running in place?
Bm                                        D
 You can have the truth but you've got to choose it.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.
'til the break of day, Let me see you make him smile.
I long to see you in the morning light.
I long to hold you In the night.
Stay lady stay, stay with your man a while.</pre>
