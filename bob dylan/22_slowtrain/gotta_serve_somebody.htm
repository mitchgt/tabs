<title>Bob Dylan: Gotta Serve Somebody</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Gotta Serve Somebody</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan <br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Slow Train Coming</em></a> (1979) and on <a href="../28_biograph/index.htm"><em>Biograph</em></a> (1985). Played in a new arrangment
during the summer 2001 tour<br>
Tabbed (a tremendous achievement, indeed...) by Eyolf Østrem </p>

<p>The A should be treated &quot;bluesily&quot;, which means that Am sounds just as good. </p>

<h3>Stirling Castle, July 13 2001</h3>

<p>For the summer tour (it was played like this at least in Gothenburg some weeks before
Stirling) he changed the arrangment of the chorus, dragging it out, much in the same way
as he changed <a href="../38_toom/trying_to_get_to_heaven.htm">Trying to get to heaven</a>
in 2000, thus slowing down the harmonic rhythm: instead of beginning the &quot;It might be
the devil...&quot; bit on the dominant (i.e. the chord on the fifth step of the scale) and
quickly descending to the key note, he instead builds up an ascent, that never reaches
higher than the fourth step (the subdominant). Quite nice, actually.<br>
The lyrics keep changing all the time, of course; the following is just a suggestion. I
may gather together some other lyric variations from throughout the years one of these
days. </p>

<pre>Might own guns, might even own tanks
Might believe in [luxury or] somebody's bank
Maybe sleeping on the highway, sleeping in the road
Walking down the highbrow, or you're carrying a heavy load</pre>

<pre>Might be [...], walkin' down the floor
Might be headin' for the moon, walking out the door.
Maybe living in a [dream], sleepin' in a feather bed
Might feel like you're living, might even feel like a living dead.</pre>
