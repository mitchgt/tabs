He saw an animal that liked to growl,
B                              Em
Big furry paws and he liked to howl,
Em                             A
Great big furry back and furry hair.
B                         Em
&quot;Ah, think I'll call it a bear.&quot;

He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing*) up so much grass until she was filled.
He saw milk comin' out but he didn't know how.
&quot;Ah, think I'll call it a cow.&quot;

He saw an animal that liked to snort,
Horns on his head and they weren't too short.
It looked like there wasn't nothin' that he couldn't pull.
&quot;Ah, think I'll call it a bull.&quot;

He saw an animal leavin' a muddy trail,
Real dirty face and a curly tail.
He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big.
&quot;Ah, think I'll call it a pig.&quot;**)

Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet,
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep.
&quot;Ah, think I'll call it a sheep.&quot;

He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass.
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake . . .</pre>

<p>*) I do prefer the occasional variation: &quot;smoking up . . .&quot;</p>

<p>**) Even here I prefer the variant &quot;think I'll call it a horse&quot; (Fow
Warfield, Nov 1980) One evening this was a cow too. </p>
