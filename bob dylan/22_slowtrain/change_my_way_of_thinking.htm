<h1>Change My Way Of Thinking</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Slow Train Coming</em></a> (1979)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>there isn't really much of a chord structure here, just a 12-bar blues riff. The tab is
just a suggestion - it could be played elsewhere and in other octaves - and so is the
chords in parenthesis. </p>

stop being influenced by fools.

So much oppression,
Can't keep track of it no more.
So much oppression,
Can't keep track of it no more.
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers,
And old men turning young daughters into whores.

Stripes on your shoulders,
Stripes on your back and on your hands.
Stripes on your shoulders,
Stripes on your back and on your hands.
Swords piercing your side,
Blood and water flowing through the land.

Well don't know which one is worse,
Doing your own thing or just being cool.
Well don't know which one is worse,
Doing your own thing or just being cool.
You remember only about the brass ring,
You forget all about the golden rule.

You can mislead a man,
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.
You can mislead a man,
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes.
But there's only one authority,
And that's the authority on high.

I got a God-fearing woman,
One I can easily afford.
I got a God-fearing woman,
One I can easily afford.
She can do the Georgia crawl,
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord.

Jesus said, &quot;Be ready,
For you know not the hour in which I come.&quot;
Jesus said, &quot;Be ready,
For you know not the hour in which I come.&quot;
He said, &quot;He who is not for Me is against Me,&quot;
Just so you know where He's coming from.

There's a kingdom called Heaven,
A place where there is no pain of birth.
There's a kingdom called Heaven,
A place where there is no pain of birth.
Well the Lord created it, mister,
About the same time He made the earth.</pre>

<h3>The version from <i>Gotta Serve Somebody - The Gospel Songs of Bob Dylan </i>
(2003)(with Mavis Staples) </h3>
<p>The tab below is just a synthesis of what is played in most of the verses. 
There are variations, one of the most prominent being the use of parallel fifths 
(i.e. power chords) instead of single notes, at least in some of the verses, as 
indicated in the first bar.</p>
