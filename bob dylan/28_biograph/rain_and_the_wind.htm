<h1>The Rain And The Wind</h1>

<p>When that I was and a little tiny boy,<br>
&nbsp; With a hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
A foolish thing was but a toy,<br>
&nbsp; For the rain it raineth every&nbsp; day.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But when I came to man's estate,<br>
&nbsp; With a&nbsp; hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
'Gainst knnaves and thieves men shut their gate,<br>
&nbsp; For the rain it raineth every day.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But when I came, alas, to wive,<br>
&nbsp; With a hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
By swaggering could I never thrive,<br>
&nbsp; For the&nbsp; rain it raineth every day.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But when I came unto my beds,<br>
&nbsp; With a hey, ho, the wind and the rain,<br>
With tosspots still had drunken heads,<br>
&nbsp; For the rain&nbsp; it raineth every day.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A great while ago the world begun,<br>
&nbsp; With a hey, ho, the wind&nbsp; and the rain,<br>
But that's all one, our play is done,<br>
&nbsp; And we'll strive to&nbsp; please you every day.<br>
