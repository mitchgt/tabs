<pre>G         Am
You got a lotta nerve
C                 G  
To say you are my friend
     G     D
When I was down
C        Em          D
You just stood there grinning &nbsp; </pre>

<pre>You got a lotta nerve
To say you gota helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning &nbsp; </pre>

<p>You say I let you down<br>
You know it's not like that<br>
If you're so hurt<br>
Why then don't you show it &nbsp; </p>

<p>You say you lost your faith<br>
But that's not where it's at<br>
You had no faith to lose<br>
And you know it &nbsp; </p>

<p>I know the reason<br>
That you talk behind my back<br>
I used to be among the crowd<br>
You're in with &nbsp; </p>

<p>Do you take me for such a fool<br>
To think I'd make contact<br>
With the one who tries to hide<br>
What he don't know to begin with &nbsp; </p>

<p>You see me on the street<br>
You always act surprised<br>
You say, &quot;How are you?&quot; &quot;Good luck&quot;<br>
But you don't mean it &nbsp; </p>

<p>When you know as well as me<br>
You'd rather see me paralyzed<br>
Why don't you just come out once<br>
And scream it &nbsp; </p>

<p>No, I do not feel that good<br>
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace<br>
If I was a master thief<br>
Perhaps I'd rob them &nbsp; </p>

<p>And now I know you're dissatisfied<br>
With your position and your place<br>
Don't you understand<br>
It's not my problem &nbsp; </p>

<p>I wish that for just one time<br>
You could stand inside my shoes<br>
And just for that one moment<br>
I could be you &nbsp; </p>

<p>Yes, I wish that for just one time<br>
You could stand inside my shoes<br>
You'd know what a drag it is<br>
To see you</p>
