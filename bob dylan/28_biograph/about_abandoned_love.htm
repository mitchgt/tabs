<p></font><font size="3"><font face="Garamond">On a Thursday night in July 1975, I headed
out to see Ramblin' Jack Elliott at The Bitter End in New York City. Because I wanted to
learn his technique, I got there early enough to get a seat near the front so I could
watch him play guitar. After the first set, a P.A. announcement told us we were welcome to
stay for the second set if we honored the two-drink minimum. As the lights flashed on and
I got up to leave, I glanced around the club and was stunned to see Bob Dylan seated
toward the back with Jack, wearing the same striped tee shirt and leather jacket he had on
in a photo with Patti Smith on the cover of the then-current Village Voice. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Naturally, I sat right back down. There was absolutely no way I
was leaving at that point. Soon, others began to notice him, too, so Jack and Bob left
their seats and went backstage. But when the engineer set up another microphone, we knew
Bob was going to sit in. The electricity in the room was tangible as the club began
filling up with more bodies. Finally, Jack came out and started his set. After a couple of
songs, he began &quot;With God on Our Side.&quot; After the first few lines, he turned his
head toward the back of the stage and said, &quot;Bob, you want to help me out on
this?&quot; The place went nuts as Dylan walked onstage. I can still see that shy look on
his face as he nervously squinted out into the audience. He was so nervous, in fact, that
he didn't notice that the capo on his guitar was crooked and buzzing badly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Their first song was &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd,&quot; with Bob
singing harmony and his guitar buzzing right along. Then Jack started &quot;How Long
Blues.&quot; After the first verse, he looked at Bob in a way that seemed to ask him to
sing a verse. Bob simply shook his head and mouthed something inaudible. When the song
finished, however, Dylan began strumming his guitar. But since it was still buzzing, he
asked Jack to trade instruments with him. At that moment, everyone in the room was in a
trance; it's not every day one gets to hear an impromptu Bob Dylan performance in a tiny
club. After a couple of lines, we realized he was performing a new song, with each line
getting even better than the last. The song was &quot;Abandoned Love,&quot; and it still
is the most powerful performance I've ever heard. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Ramblin' Jack started strumming along in the beginning, but he
soon realized the rarity of the moment and stopped and stepped to the side. As Bob sang,
the nervousness so evident earlier vanished completely. He was so moving. There he was,
hitting us with new material, with everyone hanging on his every word. It was an
incredible feeling to be in that small club listening to Bob Dylan perform a new song. We
all felt we were watching history in the making. After he finished, he returned to his
seat near the back of the club and quietly watched the rest of the show. Jack appeared so
speechless and overwhelmed by Dylan's performance that he started his next song with Bob's
buzzing guitar. </font></p>

<p><font face="Garamond">Later, as we began filing out into the night onto Bleecker
Street, we could see Bobby Dylan through the outside windows, leaning over his table and
deep in conversation with someone, the candle in front of him highlighting his face. It's
a moment I'll never forget. </font></font><font face="Ariel, Helvetica" size="-1"></p>
