<pre>  C/g        G7'
I can't understand
        C/g      G7'
She let go of my hand
    C/g          G7'        C    Csus4   C
An' left me here facing the wall
    C/g          G7'
I'd sure like to know
C/g         G7'
Why she did go
    C/g         G7'             C   Csus4  C
But I can't get close to her at all
          Am                              Em
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
    F                    G  G6 G7
She said she would never forget
        C/g      G7'
But now mornin's clear
     C/g          G7'
It's like I ain't here
    C/g          G7    C
She acts like we never met.</pre>

<pre>It's all new to me
Like some mystery 
It could even be like a myth
But it's hard to think on
That she's the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreamin' yet?
I wish she'd unlock 
Her voice once and talk
'Stead of acting like we never met</pre>

<pre>If she ain't feelin' well
Then why don't she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me to return to or chase
Though her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met.</pre>

<pre>If I didn't have to guess
I'd gladly confess
To anything I might've tried
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong
I wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide
Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don't
evidently she won't
She just acts like we never have met.</pre>

<pre>I'm leavin' today
I'll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me: &quot;Is it easy to forget?&quot;
I say, &quot;It's easily done
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met.&quot;</pre>
