<pre>       D'       C
Go 'way from my window
D'                       G
Leave at your own chosen speed
    D'              C       
I'm not the one you want, babe
    D'              G
I'm not the one you need
    Bm7'               Am7
You say you're lookin' for someone
            Bm7'            Am7
Who's never weak but always strong
      Bm7'           Am
To protect you an' defend you
        Bm7'             Am
Whether you are right or wrong
    C                          D
Someone to open each and every door
             G
But it ain't me, babe
C       D            G
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
         C         D       G
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.


Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I will only let your down
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you an' more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.

Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
An' anyway I'm not alone
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
An' to come each time you call
A lover for you life an' nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're lookin' for, babe.</pre>
