<pre>G                     C          
Some time ago a crazy dream came to me,
  D                                              /f#
I dreamt I was walkin' into World War Three,
  G                      C
I went to the doctor the very next day
   D
To see what kinda words he could say.
           /f#   G            /a  /b
He said it was a bad dream.
C                                      
I wouldn't worry 'bout it none, though,
          (/b)   D                                      /f#  G
They were my own dreams and they're only in my head.</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain.&quot;<br>
He said, &quot;Nurse, get your pad, the boy's insane,&quot;<br>
He grabbed my arm, I said &quot;Ouch!&quot;<br>
As I landed on the psychiatric couch,<br>
He said, &quot;Tell me about it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, the whole thing started at 3 o'clock fast,<br>
It was all over by quarter past.<br>
I was down in the sewer with some little lover<br>
When I peeked out from a manhole cover<br>
Wondering who turned the lights on us.<br>
<br>
Well, I got up and walked around<br>
up and down the lonesome town.<br>
I stood a-wondering which way to go,<br>
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter<br>
And walked on down the road.<br>
It was a normal day.<br>
<br>
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell<br>
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell,<br>
&quot;Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man.&quot;<br>
A shotgun fired and away I ran.<br>
I don't blame them too much though,<br>
they didn't know me.<br>
<br>
Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand<br>
I seen a man, <br>
I said, &quot;Howdy friend, I guess there's just us two.&quot;<br>
He screamed a bit and away he flew.<br>
Thought I was a Communist.<br>
<br>
Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave,<br>
I said: &quot;Let's go and play Adam and Eve.&quot;<br>
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumpin'<br>
When she said, &quot;Hey man, you crazy or sumpin',<br>
You see what happened last time they started.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown<br>
And there was nobody aroun',<br>
I got into the driver's seat<br>
And I drove 42nd Street<br>
In my Cadillac.<br>
Good car to drive after a war.<br>
<br>
Well, I remember seein' some ad,<br>
So I turned on my Conelrad.<br>
But I didn't pay my Con Ed bill,<br>
So the radio didn't work so well.<br>
Turned on my record player -<br>
It was Rock-A-Day Johnny singin',<br>
&quot;Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa,<br>
Our Loves Are Gonna Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was feelin' kinda lonesome and blue,<br>
I needed somebody to talk to.<br>
So I called up the operator of time<br>
Just to hear a voice of some kind.<br>
&quot;When you hear the beep<br>
It will be three o'clock,&quot;<br>
She said that for over an hour<br>
And I hung it up.<br>
<br>
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then,<br>
Sayin, &quot;Hey I've been havin' the same old dreams,<br>
But mine was a little different you see.<br>
I dreamt that the only person left after the war was me.<br>
I didn't see you around.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, now time passed and now it seems<br>
Everybody's having them dreams.<br>
Everybody sees themselves walkin' around with no one else.<br>
Half of the people can be part right all of the time, <br>
and some of the people can be all right part of the time,<br>
but all of the people can't be all right all of the time.<br>
I think Abraham Lincoln said that.<br>
&quot;I'll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours,&quot;<br>
I said that.<br>
