<br>
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br>
To ride your aeroplane.<br>
Honey, just allow me one more chance<br>
To ride your passenger train.<br>
Well, I've been lookin' all over<br>
For a gal like you,<br>
I can't find nobody<br>
So you'll have to do.<br>
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,<br>
'Low me just-a one more chance.</p>

<p>Honey, just allow me one more chance<br>
To get along with you.<br>
Honey, just allow me one more chance,<br>
Ah'll do anything with you.<br>
Well, lookin' for a woman<br>
That ain't got no man,<br>
Is just lookin' for a needle<br>
That is lost in the sand.<br>
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,<br>
'Low me just-a one more chance.</p>

<p>[1 verse harmonica solo]</p>

<p>It's just-a one kind favor I ask you,<br>
'Low me just-a one more chance.</p>
