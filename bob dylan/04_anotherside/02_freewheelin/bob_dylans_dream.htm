<pre>      G           Am
While riding on a train goin' west,
              C/g    D/f# 
I fell asleep for to take my rest.
C /b G                    C/g     G
I    dreamed a dream that made me sad,
             D            C         /b        G
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.
</pre>

<p>With half-damp eyes I stared to the room<br>
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,<br>
Where we together weathered many a storm,<br>
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.<br>
<br>
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,<br>
Our words was told, our songs was sung,<br>
Where we longed for nothin' and were satisfied<br>
Jokin' and talkin' about the world outside.<br>
<br>
With hungry hearts through the heat and cold,<br>
We never much thought we could get very old.<br>
We thought we could sit forever in fun<br>
And our chances really was a million to one.<br>
<br>
As easy it was to tell black from white,<br>
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.<br>
And our choices they was few and the thought never hit<br>
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.<br>
<br>
How many a year has passed and gone,<br>
And many a gamble has been lost and won,<br>
And many a road taken by many a first friend,<br>
And each one I've never seen again.<br>
<br>
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,<br>
That we could sit simply in that room again.<br>
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,<br>
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.</p>
