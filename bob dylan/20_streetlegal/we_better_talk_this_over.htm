<pre>D                           G D
I think we better talk this over
D                      G D
Maybe when we both get sober
       G    D         G      D
You'll understand I'm only a man
          G           D
Doin' the best that I can.

This situation can only get rougher.
Why should we needlessly suffer?
Let's call it a day, go our own different ways
Before we decay.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>A                 D            G               D
You don't have to be afraid of looking into my face,
A                  D             G              A
We've done nothing to each other time will not erase.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing.
I took a chance, got caught in the trance
Of a downhill dance.

Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
I'm exiled, you can't convert me.
I'm lost in the haze of your delicate ways
With both eyes glazed.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>You don't have to yearn for love, you don't have to be alone,
Somewheres in this universe there's a place that you can call home.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>I guess I'll be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal or borrow.
It'd be great to cross paths in a day and a half
Look at each other and laugh.

But I don't think it's liable to happen
Like the sound of one hand clappin'.
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
'Neath the bed where we slept.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Don't think of me and fantasize on what we've never had,
Be grateful for what we've shared together and be glad.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>[Instrumental]</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Eventually we'll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Oh, babe, time for a new transition
I wish I was a magician.
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
That we've both gone beyond.</pre>
