Down along the cove,
E                              B
I spied my true love comin' my way.

Down along the cove,
                               B
I spied my true love comin' my way.
       F#
I say, &quot;Lord, have mercy, mama,
   E                                B
It sure is good to see you comin' today.&quot;

Down along the cove,
I spied my little bundle of joy.
Down along the cove,
I spied my little bundle of joy.
She said, &quot;Lord, have mercy, honey,
I'm so glad you're my boy!&quot;

Down along the cove,
We walked together hand in hand.
Down along the cove,
We walked together hand in hand.
Ev'rybody watchin' us go by
Knows we're in love, yes, and they understand</font></pre>
