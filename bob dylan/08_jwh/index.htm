    <h4>Eyolf Østrem</h4>
    <p>There are three general remarks to be made about this album. One is the consistent use
    of the capo. Several of the songs (<a href="john_wesley_harding.htm">John Wesley Harding</a>,
    <a href="all_along_the_watchtower.htm">All Along the Watchtower</a>, <a href="frankie_lee.htm">The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest</a>, <a href="asiwent.htm">As I went out one morning</a>, <a href="ipitythe.htm">I pity the poor
    immigrant</a>), are played with the capo around the 5th fret, which produces the high,
    ringing guitar sound that is so typical of this album (if it's successful is another
    question: it also creates a very thin, open sound-scape, with the bass and the guitar far
    removed from eachother and from the drums - they all stand very much alone; maybe he
    should have gone back to the studio and added some tracks with the Band as he originally
    planned).</p>
    <p>The other is the very simple chord progressions in many of the songs (<a href="frankie_lee.htm">The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest</a>, <a href="drifters_escape.htm">The Drifter's Escape</a>, <a href="wicked_messenger.htm">The
    Wicked Messenger</a>, not to mention <a href="all_along_the_watchtower.htm">All Along the
    Watchtower</a>). That these songs nevertheless stand out as some of the most effective on
    the album is a testimony of Dylan's superb singing on this album. </p>
    <p>His harmonica work is also outstanding. A year of wild touring with the Band may have
    come close to killing him, but his harp playing certainly became more expressive - and
    this is the only album where it shows directly, IMHO.</p>
    <p>One song stands out - in the negative sense: the <a href="john_wesley_harding.htm">title
    track</a>. It was what kept me from buying the record for several years</td>
