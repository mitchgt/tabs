<pre>           F    
Close your eyes, close the door,
                  G        
You don't have to worry any more.
Bb         C        F
I'll be your baby tonight.
</pre>

<pre>Shut the light, shut the shade,
You don't have to be afraid.
I'll be your baby tonight.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>           Bb    
Well, that mockingbird's gonna sail away,
F
We're gonna forget it.
     G
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon,
    C
But we're gonna let it,
(no chord)
You won't regret it.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Kick your shoes off, do not fear,
Bring that bottle over here.
I'll be your baby tonight.
