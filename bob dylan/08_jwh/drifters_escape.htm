<pre>     G                      *
&quot;Oh, help me in my weakness,&quot;
            C/g     G     *
I heard the drifter say,
        G              
As they carried him from the courtroom
                C/g  G     *
And were taking him away.
    G
&quot;My trip hasn't been a pleasant one
               C/g         *
And my time it isn't long,
          
And I still do not know
                 C/g       G
What it was that I've done wrong.&quot;

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,
A tear came to his eye,
&quot;You fail to understand,&quot; he said,
&quot;Why must you even try?&quot;
Outside, the crowd was stirring,
You could hear it from the door.
Inside, the judge was stepping down,
While the jury cried for more.

&quot;Oh, stop that cursed jury,&quot;
Cried the attendant and the nurse,
&quot;The trial was bad enough,
But this is ten times worse.&quot;
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape,
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape.
