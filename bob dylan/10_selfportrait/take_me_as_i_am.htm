Why must you always try to make me over
G7                        C     G7
Take me as I am or let me go
C                  C7                F
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover

  <pre>       G7                        C
You're tryin' to reshape me in a mold love
       D7                           F     G
In the image of someone you used to know
    C       /b   C7/Bb           F
But I won't be a stand-in for an old love
G7                        C     F      C
Take me as I am or let me go.  [let me go]</pre>

You tried to change me ever since you've met me
Take me as I am or let me go
If you can't overlook my faults, forget me
Take me as I am or let me go.</pre>
