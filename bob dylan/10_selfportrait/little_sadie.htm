<pre>     A       
Went out last night to take a little round.
  G              
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down.
  A
I ran right home and I went to bed
       G     [n.c.]                  A
With a forty-four smokeless under my head.

I began to think what a deed I'd done,
I grabbed my hat and away I run.
I made a god run but I run too slow; 
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standing on a corner ringin' my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville.
He said &quot;Young man is you name Brown?
Remember the night you blowed Little Sadie down.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee.
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree.
First degree and second degree,
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?&quot;

Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black.
They put me on a train and they brought me back.
I had no one for to go my bail;
They crammed me back into the county jail.

The judge and the jury they took their stand.
The judge had the papers in his hand.
Forty-one days, forty-one nights;
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes.</pre>
