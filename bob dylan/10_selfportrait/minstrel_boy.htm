<h1>Minstrel Boy</h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan<br>
Performed live on the Isle of Wight festival, and released on <em><a href="index.htm">Self
Portrait</a> </em>(1970)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The chords in the chorus are approximations only; the last line could be played with F
- Em - Dm - C as well.<br>
The lyrics are the official ones - I didn't see any reason to change them to whatever he
sings live.</p>

<pre>C                      F6       G11   C
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
            F      C
Who's gonna let it roll?
C           Em         F6       G11   C
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
            F           C       G7       C
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

    F       C         F          C
Oh, Lucky's drivin' a long, long time
    F        C        G 
And now he's stuck on top of the hill.
F                   C           F                C
With twelve forward gears, it's been a long hard climb,
         F           C                    G
And with all of them ladies, though, he's lonely still.


Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?

Well, he deep in number and heavy in toil,
Mighty Mockingbird, he still has such a heavy load.
Beneath his bound'ries, what more can I tell,
With all of his trav'lin', but I'm still on that road.

Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it roll?
Who's gonna throw that minstrel boy a coin?
Who's gonna let it down easy to save his soul?</pre>
