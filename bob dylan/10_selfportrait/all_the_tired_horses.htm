<h1>All The Tired Horses </h1>

<p>Written by Bob Dylan <br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Self Portrait</em></a> (1970), probably the only Dylan
album which has never been underestimated (enough)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem (there is actually a little finesse here which justifies the term)</p>

<p>Emsus4 (that's the finesse) is played 022010 (or at least it sounds as if there is a c
there somewhere; it's probably just an overtone somewhere, and played as a straight Em
chord. So much for finesse . . .)</p>
