Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on.

Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long; 
       C                      D      A
And it seems like I've got to travel on,
       C               D             A
And it seems like I've got to travel on.</pre>

<pre>That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Going home to stay, going home to stay.
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
And I feel like I just want to travel on. </pre>

<pre>There's a lonesome freight at 6:08 coming through the town,
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
There's a lonesome freight at 6:08 coming through the town,
And I feel like I just want to travel on. </pre>
