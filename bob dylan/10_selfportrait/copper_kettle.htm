Get you a copper kettle,   get you a copper coil,
G      Am7            G      Am7    C          /b     Am
Fill it with new-made corn mash and never more you'll toil.</pre>

You'll just lay there by the juniper 
C                 G
while the moon is bright,
C          /b     Am
Watch them jugs a-filling 
       C(maj7)     G
In the pale    moonlight. </pre>

Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak,
G            Am7      G         Am7        C          
Don't use no green or rotten wood; they'll get you by the smoke.</pre>
