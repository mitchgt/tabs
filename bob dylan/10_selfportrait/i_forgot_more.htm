<pre>G
You think you know
                 D
The smile on her lips

The thrill an' the touch 
             G
Of her fingertips
             C         G           D          C      C  G/b  Am  G  
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.</pre>

<pre>
You think you'll find
A heaven of bliss
In each caress
In each tender kiss
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>C
You stole her love from me one day
G
You didn't care how it hurt me
A7
But you can never steal away
D7
Memories of what used to be.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>You think she's yours
To have and to hold
Someday you'll learn
When her love grows cold
But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her.</pre>
