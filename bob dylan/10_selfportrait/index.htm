    <td width="69%" valign="top" align="left">&quot;What is this shit?!&quot; wrote Greil
    Marcus in his <em>Rolling Stone</em> review of this album, and there is something to that
    question. There are only three possible explanations to the mix of the blatant
    sentimentality of <a href="i_forgot_more.htm">I forgot more</a> (and a bunch of others),
    the ludicrous chord changes of &quot;<a href="in_search_of_little_sadie.htm">In search of
    Little Sadie</a>&quot;, the duet between the old, nasal Dylan and the new country-crooner
    Dylan on &quot;The Boxer&quot;, which is fun on the first hearing, but gets quite dull
    already on the second (and I don't know what happens after the second hearing), and - the
    best of them all - &quot;<a href="all_the_tired_horses.htm">All the tired horses</a>&quot;,
    which brilliantly captures the mood of this album.<p>Either it was, as Dylan himself has
    explained, conceived as a collection of country standards, maybe inspired by the sessions
    with Johnny Cash in 1969. This would imply that it's a serious effort. If so, it's the
    best proof that his muse was silent at the moment (as Paul Williams asks: if the tracks
    that ended up on <em>Self Portrait </em>and <em>Dylan</em> were just warm-ups for the
    band, then where are the <em>real</em> tracks?). </p>
    <p>Or it was, as Dylan himself has <em>also</em> explained, an attempt to shake off the
    annoying role of icon and voice of a generation that he felt he was being forced into and
    kept locked up in - a big &quot;fuck you&quot; to everyone caring to take it as a
    provocation. But why then the effort? There are more sessions for these albums (counting
    also <em>New Morning</em>) than for any other Dylan album. And why the inclusion of tracks
    that are actually quite enjoyable, among the shit?</p>
    <p>Or was it, perhaps, an ironic kick in the butt to the country idiom, and a clever,
    multi-level analysis of sentimentality and of his own music-making, where the packaging
    adds to the wit of the music?</p>
    <p>I wish I could say that the third alternative is the correct answer, but I can't. What
    I can say is that Dylan was experimenting with his singing style, not only in the
    direction of country, but also a blues style which sounds new (and actually quite fresh!)
    in his oeuvre. They also seem to be having a good time, at least on some of the tracks
    (whereas others sound very uninspired). It is an amusing album, but not a good one... </p>

    <p>Postscript:<br>
    Having lived with this album for a couple of days, I have quite reluctantly reached the
    conclusion (&quot;insight&quot; is too strong a word) that the most interesting songs on
    the album are &quot;In search if little Sadie&quot; (heard in conjunction with
    &quot;Little Sadie&quot;, of course) and All the Tired Horses. They both stretch some
    limits that aren't usually touched upon. What's interesting about the &quot;Search for
    little Sadie&quot;, is that it's a stylized search - it sounds like (and is probably meant
    to sound like) Dylan sitting at home, searching for a melody, trying out things,
    discarding them on the way, and picking up the next thing to try out. But it isn't: it's a
    planned progression through various stages, planned so as to sound erratic. At times it is
    genuinely erratic, of course, but only on the surface level: the chromatic progression of
    chords in the first half leads Dylan to melodic goals he can't have foreseen (which is
    evident from the recording - lots of sliding-up-to the last note of a phrase, to make it
    fit the chord). But the course through the song is orderly enough to be labeled
    &quot;planned&quot;. This ambiguity puts the aesthetics both of improvised and of
    pre-planned music (which is to say: the entire history of Western Classical Music) under
    scrutiny, by using the one to nullify the other. What remains, may be crap, but at least
    it's interesting crap (oh my, I'm turning into a garbologist!)</p>
    <p>Wigwam stretches limits too, but mostly those of patience.</p>

    <p><em>Hello-<br>
    Just picked this one up this afternoon.&nbsp; I have the following to say: That is $11.99
