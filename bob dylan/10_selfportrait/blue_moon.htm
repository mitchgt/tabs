<p>Lorenz Hart &amp; Richard Rodgers<br>
Recorded by Bob Dylan for <a href="index.htm"><em>Self Portrait</em></a> (1970)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<pre>C
     [n.c.]                    C    Am
Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Dm         G           C     Am
 Without a dream in my heart
Dm         G          C    Am   Dm  G
 Without a love of my own.

Blue moon you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>Dm                    G        C       Am
Then suddenly there appeared before me
    Dm          G               C
The only one my arms could ever hold
Fm              Bb                Eb
I heard someone whisper, &quot;Please adore me&quot;
    G                D                  G
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>Blue moon now I am no longer alone
Without a dream in may heart
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own.</pre>
