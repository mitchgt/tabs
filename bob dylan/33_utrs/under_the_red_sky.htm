<pre>There was an old man and he lived in the moon, 
One summer's day he came passing by. 
There was an old man and he lived in the moon, 
And one day he came passing by.</pre>

<pre>G                    B                              E 
Someday little girl, everything for you is gonna be new

Someday little girl you'll have a diamond as big as your shoe</pre>

<pre>Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high. 
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie. 
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high. 
One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie.</pre>

<pre>This is the key to the kingdom and this is the town 
This is the blind horse that leads you around</pre>

<pre>Let the bird sing, let the bird fly, 
One day the man in the moon went home and the river went dry. 
Let the bird sing, let the bird fly, 
The man in the moon went home and the river went dry.</pre>
