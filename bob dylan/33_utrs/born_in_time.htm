<pre>       G
In the lonely night 
                              Em
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light 
                            Am7
You're comin' thru to me in black and white 
     C       Cm      G
When we were made of dreams.</pre>

<pre>You're blowing down the shaky street, 
You're hearing my heart beat 
In the record breaking heat 
Where we were born in time.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>             G                   D  
Not one more night, not one more kiss, 
              C                G/B
Not this time baby, no more of this. 
               G                     D
Takes too much skill, takes too much will. 
           G
It's too revealing. 
              G                  D
You came, you saw, just like the law 
            C                     G/B
You married young, just like your ma, 
              G                  Am
You tried and tried, you made me slide 
            D   
You left me reelin' 
G/B           C
with this feelin'.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>On the rising curve 
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve, 
You won't get anything you don't deserve 
Where we were born in time.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>You pressed me once, you pressed me twice, 
You hang the flame, you'll pay the price. 
Oh babe, that fire 
Is still smokin'. 
You were snow, you were rain 
You were striped, you were plain, 
Oh babe, truer words 
Have not been spoken 
or broken.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>In the hills of mystery, 
In the foggy web of destiny, 
You can have what's left of me, 
Where we were born in time.</pre>

<pre>On the rising curve 
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve, 
I took you close and got what I deserved 
When we were born in time.</pre>

And just when the whole

<pre>In the hills of mystery, 
In the foggy web of destiny, 
I think of you from deep inside of me, 
When we were born in time.</pre>
