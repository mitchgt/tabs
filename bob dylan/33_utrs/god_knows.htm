<h1>God Knows</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Recorded - and discarded - for <a href="../31_ohmercy/index.htm"><em>Oh Mercy</em></a>,
but given a second chance on <em><a href="index.htm">Under The Red Sky</a> </em>(1990).<br>
May not have come out perfectly in the studio, but live this is a gem.</p>

<p>I give two versions: one with G chords, the other with E chords. Both seem to have been
used, but what he plays in concerts it is actually the E version, although the intro
(before the band enters) sounds suspiciously like his dear old G-C/g-G turn.</p>

<hr>

<h3><em>Under the Red Sky </em>version</h3>

<p>Capo 3rd fret (sounding key Bb major)</p>

<p>The last three verses are played without the G+ - Em/b in the second half - just plain
G-C/g all the way through.</p>

<pre>G                    C/g 
 God knows you ain't pretty,
G               C/g
 God knows it's true.
G                G+
 God knows there ain't anybody
     Em/b                       G
Ever gonna take the place of you.</pre>

<pre>
God knows it's a struggle,
God knows it's a crime,
God knows there's gonna be no more water
But fire next time.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>C
God don't call it treason,
G
God don't call it wrong,
A
It was s'posed to last a season
             D
But it's been so strong for so long.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>God knows it's fragile,
God knows everything,
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string.</pre>

<blockquote>
  <pre>God knows it's terrifying,
God sees it all unfold,
There's a million reasons for you to be crying
You been so bold and so cold.</pre>
</blockquote>

<pre>God knows that when you see it,
God knows you've got to weep,
God knows the secrets of your heart,
He'll tell them to you when you're asleep.

God knows there's a river,
God knows how to make it flow,
God knows you ain't gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go.

God knows there's a purpose,
God knows there's a chance,
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance.

God knows there's a heaven,
God knows it's out of sight,
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
Even if we've got to walk a million miles by candlelight.</pre>

<hr>

<p>To match the live renditions, the verses would have to go (Eb = (e.g.) 3110xx):</p>

<pre>G                    C/g 
 God knows you ain't pretty,
G               C/g
 God knows it's true.
G                      Eb
 God knows there ain't anybody
     C                       G
Ever gonna take the place of you.</pre>
