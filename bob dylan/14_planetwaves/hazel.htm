<title>Bob Dylan: Hazel (from Planet Waves - 1974)</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Hazel</h1>

<p>Words and music Bob Dylan<br>
Released on <a href="index.htm"><em>Planet Waves</em></a> (1974)<br>
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem</p>

<p>The song could equally well be played with C chords and a capo on the 4th fret. Such a
version is appended at the end.</p>

<p>The intro is played rather freely (which is a nice way of saying that they aren't
exactly tight...) - and with both a bass and a guitar. The tab below is just a suggestion
of an approximation. </p>

<pre>E      G#
Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
A                           F#7
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.
E                   G#          C#m   E/b  A
You got something I want plenty of
E             B             A   G#m  F#m  E
Ooh, a little touch of your love. &nbsp; </pre>

<pre>Hazel, stardust in your eye
You're goin' somewhere and so am I.
I'd give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love. &nbsp; </pre>

  <pre>G#                        C#m
Oh no, I don't need any reminder
G#                        C#m
To know how much I really care
F#          
But it's just making me blinder and blinder
            B       A        G#m              F#m
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there. &nbsp; </pre>

<pre>Hazel, you called and I came,
Now don't make me play this waiting game.
You've got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love.
