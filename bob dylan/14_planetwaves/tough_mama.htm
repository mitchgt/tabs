  I'm gonna

  go down to the river and get some stones.

Sister's on the highway with that steel-drivin' crew,

Can I blow a little smoke on you?
</pre>

<pre>Dark Beauty
Won't you move it on over and make some room?
It's my duty 
to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
Dark Beauty
With that long night's journey in your eyes.
</pre>

<pre>Sweet Goddess
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, 
you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north
He's buried in your past.
The Lone Wolf went out drinking
That was over pretty fast.</pre>

<pre>
Sweet Goddess
Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.
Silver Angel
With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive.
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch,
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch.
Sweet Goddess
It must be time to carve another notch.

I'm crestfallen
The world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't a-haulin' 
any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.
Dark Beauty
Meet me at the border late tonight.</pre>
