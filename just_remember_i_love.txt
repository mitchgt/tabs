Just Remember I Love You

Firefall

INTRO: Fmaj7-5  Fmaj7  Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7  Em  Em7  Em Em7

VERSE 1:
        Fmaj7-5  Fmaj7         Fmaj7-5   Fmaj7
When it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone
    G6
the days get rainy and the night gets long;
         Fmaj7-5  Fmaj7            Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7
when you get that feeling you were born to lose,
Em                       Fmaj7-5         Fmaj7   Fmaj7-5  Fmaj7  G6
staring at your ceiling, thinking of your blues;

             Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7            Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7
When there's so much trouble that you want to cry,
    G6 
the world has crumbled and you don't know why;
          Fmaj7-5   Fmaj7           Fmaj7-5  Fmaj7
when your hopes are fading and they can't be found,
Em                            Fmaj7
dreams have left you waiting, friends have let you down:

CHORUS: (lead-in: G  C)
        G            Fmaj7
just remember I love you,
          C      G      Fmaj7    C
and it'll be all right.
        G            Fmaj7
Just remember I love you
                C     G  Fmaj7
more than I can say.

BRIDGE: (lead-in: Am)
                G
Maybe then your blues
         Fmaj7
will fade away.

VERSE 2: (lead-in: Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7  G6)
        Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7          Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7         
When you need a lover and your down so low,
    G6
you start to wonder, but you never know;
        Fmaj7-5    Fmaj7         Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7
when it feels like sorrow is your only friend,
Em                    Fmaj7-5              Fmaj7
knowing that tomorrow you'll feel this way again;


INSTRUMENTAL: (lead-in: Fmaj7-5 Fmaj7  G6) -
 (play same chords as first part of verse, without verse lead-in)

         Fmaj7-5   Fmaj7           Fmaj7-5  Fmaj7
when the blues come callin' at the break of dawn,
    G6
the rain keeps fallin', but the rainbow's gone;
         Fmaj7-5   Fmaj7           Fmaj7-5     Fmaj7
when you feel like cryin', but the tears won't come,
Em                          Fmaj7
then your dreams are dyin', then you're on the run:

REPEAT CHORUS: (once) ---->

OUTTRO: (lead-in: C)
        G           Fmaj7
Just remember I love you,
          Am        G6   Fmaj7
and it'll be all right,
      Am        G6   Fmaj7
it'll be all right ... (repeat this line 3 times and end on Cmaj7)

Subject: Re: REQ: "Just Remember I Love You (And It'll Be Alright)"??

This song is by Firefall and you have the title correct.
I play this one sometimes but it has been a while since I heard it.  I 
believe the opening chords are like this :

F? FMaj7 G? G6
-0--0----0--0-----0--0----0--0-----------------------------
-0--1----0--1-----0--3----0--3-----------------------------
-2--2----2--2-----4--4----4--4-----------------------------
-3--3----3--3-----5--5----5--5-----------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------

This repeats for the verses I will try to notate where this is not the 
case.

Here are the lyrics as I remember them (your mileage may vary)

When it all goes crazy and the thrill is gone
Your days get rainy and your nights get long
And you get that feeling you were born to lose 
Em                      Am 
Starin' at your ceiling dreamin' of your blues

When there's so much trouble that you wanna' cry
Your world has crumbled and you don't know why
And your hopes are fading and they can't be found
Em                            Am                        (Some transition)
Dreams have kept you waiting friends have let you down (maybe quick Am D)

(Chorus)
C     G         F                  C     G   F
Just remember I love you and it'll be alright
C     G         F                     C     G   F
Just remember I love more than I can say
C     G         F                  C     G   F
Just remember I love you and it'll be alright
Em               Am              (return to chors for verses)
Maybe then your blues will fade away

(My memory is a bit blurry on this verse)
When you need a lover and your down so low 
You start to wonder but you never know 
And you feel like cryin' but the tears won't come
Em                              Am
(Something something something) when your on the run

(Repeat Chorus and fade)
