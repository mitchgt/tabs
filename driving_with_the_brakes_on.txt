driving with the brakes on 
Capo on 3rd fret

C
Driving through the long night
                                       Am
Trying to figure who's right and who's wrong
                      C
Now the kid has gone. I sit belted up tight.
                                    Am            
She sucks on a match light, glowing bronze, steering on.
      F                        G
And I might be more a man if I stopped this in it's tracks
              Am           C         F
And said come on, let's go home. But she's got the wheel.
    G                                   Am     F
And I've got nothing except what I have on.

CHORUS:
                              C
When you're driving with the brakes on.
                                 Am
When you're swimming with you're boots on.
                            F             G
It's hard to say you love someone
                                Am      F
And it's hard to say you don't.


Trying to keep the mood right, trying to steer the conversation from
The thing we've done.
She shuts up the ashtray and I say it's a long way back now hon
And she just yawns. And we might get lost someplace
So desolate that no one where we're from would ever come
But she's got the wheel and I've got to deal from now on.


When you're driving with the brakes on.
When you're swimming with you're boots on.
It's hard to say you love someone
And it's hard to say you don't.

                  C             Am   F                  Am    F    C
But unless the moon falls tonight,   unless continents collide.
                Am     F    G            Am     F    G
Nothing's gonna make me  break from her side.


                             C
When you're driving with the brakes on.
                                 Am
When you're swimming with you're boots on.
                           F             G
It's hard to say you love someone
                         Am           F    G
And it's hard to say you don't.
                           F            G
It's hard to say you love someone
                               Am        F  C
And it's hard to say you don't.
