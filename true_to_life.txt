True to Life
By: Uncle Tupelo

G                       D
Walking lonely, singing loud
       G               D
Always try and sing it clear
         G                     D
What the Hell are we all doing here
       G           D
Making too much of nothing
   G        D
Or creating one unholy mess
G         D        G          D
An unfair study in survival I guess
Em                  C               G
But it always comes down to what to do
                     D
When it's all around you
         G         G/F# D          G
And this tightwire act, leaving us here for
G                    D
Dead to news and the world
   G       D
in liquor, piles up
G              D                G
ahead got your nose in words of power
D               G               G/F#
Forever on your breath when the quality of life
     Am                            C
gets tripped up and strangled like death
D
Seems it's getting harder out there
C                  Am             D
especially without time enough to see

True to life, is another hangover
True to life is more and more politics
True to life is always having to look over your shoulder
True to life is assembly line sickness
But it always comes down to what to do
When it's all around you
(chorus)
