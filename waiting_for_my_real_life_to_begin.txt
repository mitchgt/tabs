Waiting For My Real Life To Begin
Colin Hay
Going Somewhere
Tabbed by Ian Dulley (iandulley@yahoo.co.uk)

The timing here is hard to judge from the tab alone.
I suggest you read this tab whilst listening to the
song to figure out how it goes.
At present I have only given the chords, but there's
some fingerpicking/arpeggio picking going on
throughout the song, just try to improvise, you can't
really make it sound bad.

When I awoke today,
