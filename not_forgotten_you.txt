Came home a little early last night
C                      F
Shed not a tear when I turned out the light
C          G                F
No I don't hurt like I used to

C                   Am
Didn't wait for the knock on my door
C                        F
Drawer in the room ain't empty anymore
C              G              F
So many got it tougher than I do

F          G
But I have not forgotten
F          G
I have not forgotten
F          G         C    F     C    F
I have not forgotten you

C              Am
Time flies and you just know
C                   F  
Time to think about letting go
C            G            F
Times I even forget to be blue

C           Am
Big feet to shufle them sands
C                  F
Leave no trail and slip right through your hands
C          G                     F
Done every little thing I know to do
F          G
But I have not forgotten
F          G
I have not forgotten
F          G         C    F     C    F
I have not forgotten you

            Am                               D7
And I said "Hail the western bound with it's black tail flying"
F
Lay on the rails and leave me to dream
G
Of where your love was mine

SOLO

C              Am
Time flies and you just know
C                   F  
Time to think about letting go
C            G            F
Times I even forget to be blue

F          G
But I have not forgotten
F          G
I have not forgotten
F          G         C    
I have not forgotten you
F          G
But I have not forgotten
F          G
I have not forgotten
F          G         Am
I have not forgotten you
F          G
But I have not forgotten
F          G
I have not forgotten
F          G         C    F     C    F   C
I have not forgotten you
