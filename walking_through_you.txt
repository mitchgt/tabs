Walking Through You (Capo 7th Fret)

       C  Em               F
In The evening when you're blue
         Am   Em          G      F
You will feel me walking through you
             C  Em             F
when you're cry-ing, that's my cue
     Am  Em            G      F
My remin-ding walking through you

             C  Em             F
When you're sin-ging something true
        Am    Em            G       F
I'll be liste-ning, walking through you
          C    Em             F
And those memo-ries, that you lose
      Am   Em            G      F
I can find then walking through you

         C   G                           F     Am
When you dan-ce, and your baby's dancing too
     F   G        F  G         C       G       C        G
Then I-----  will wa-lk though you.

       C   Em          F
In The win-dows in the view
          Am  Em          G      F
There's a sha-dow walking though you
            C  Em              F
When you're co-ld, when you're cruel
          Am  Em          G       F
That's my sor-row walking through you

         C  G                         F        Am
When you Wa-ke in the silence of your room
     F   G        F  G         C
then I------ will wa-lk though you.
