Halloween

Heart stops beating all the words worth repeating
She is dancing but not singing is it maybe that she doesn't know the words
She's dressed up but don't worry man she's got friends

Snowflake eating she is mildly self-defeating
And the secrets she is keeping are really only dangerous to her
Ships ain't sinking

We are here to help you sing your songs
We are here to help you sing your songs
Because tomorrow comes and no one calls

She stops grinning when the room it starts spinning
She's losing all her winnings she's angry but it's just the alcohol
She's all fucked right up
It's okay man she's got friends

We are here to help her sing her songs
We are here to help her sing her songs
Because tomorrow's gonna come and no one's gonna call

This isn't Christmas this is Chinatown and those are pretty lights
Just use some more and put on all your make up dough
There's a painting underneath her every smile unseen
And it's just like Christmas if it was Halloween

Someone taught her it's okay to be a martyr
Like an educated angel be a rat you know in all that shit you love
Well okay

Priceless pictures she's collected
Iceless fixtures she is freezing
From the people she has chosen to help her through it all
Whatever

We are here to help you sing your songs
We are here to help you sing your songs
We are here to help you sing your songs
Because tomorrow's gonna come
Tomorrow's gonna come
And no one's gonna call
