GOT A FEELIN' FOR YA (Dan Penn & Chuck Prophet)
-----------------------------------------------
[Each chord is one measure, except pairs of chords joined with hyphens
 (e.g., F#m - E) are one measure total.]
[You could easily play E as E7.]

E   E   A   A
[intro]

         E              E
I might bark at you and get a little loud
  A               A
Embarrass you someday in a crowd
      E                                   E
Might run you 'round in circles, make you dizzy in the head
         A                               A
I might run you ragged once or twice, forget to get you fed

             F#m           C#7
But hold on tight, let it roll right over you
           F#m      -     E          D  -  Dm6
You should know I'd never do you no harm
               A              E7            A       A
'Cause I got a feelin' for ya,  a real deep feelin'

Sometimes I get a little stubborn, feels like you're talking to a wall
It don't mean that I don't love you, baby, it don't mean nothing at all

Well cans are made for kicking, kicking all night and day
When I get stuck on something, baby, nothing can pull me away

Hold on tight, let it roll right over you
You should know I'd never do you no harm
'Cause I got a feelin' for ya, a real deep feelin'

E   E   A   A
[intro]

I hear bells a-ringing, it's coming down the street
I'm in the mood for something sticky, I need my ice cream treat
The road may get rocky, and the ride may get rough
I might drive you crazy, you might think you've had enough

But hold on tight, let it roll right over you
You should know I'd never do you no harm
               A              E7            A       E7             A
'Cause I got a feelin' for ya,  a real deep feelin',  a real deep feelin'
E7                             A
Something how I feel about you
    E7                                         A 
I'd never let no one or nothin' mistreat you, baby
E7                     A
Crazy as I am, I got a feelin'
E7            A.
Whoaaaaaa....
