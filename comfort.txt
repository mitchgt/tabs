[Bm] [A] [G] [D] [A] x 2

I was [Bm]sitting in hell's kitchen
Contemplating [A]murder
Contemplating [G]murder
Contemplating [D]the great es[A]cape
When [Bm]you walked in looking like crap
But [A]satisfied
I swear that you looked [G]satisfied
And I hated you for [D]that [A]

Well [Bm]someone once said
If you never look back
Then you'll never regret, [A]nothing
Oh but [G]nothing has got a way
Of sneakin' [D]up [A]

[Bm] [A] [G] [D] [A]

Well I [G]know you did not ask
But I've [D]got some comfort to offer
[A]Nothing very good or bad ever [Bm]lasts [A]

[Bm] [A] [G] [D] [A]

Well the [Bm]bum that slipped
Underneath the fridge
Like a phantom card,
We call him happi[A]ness
Oh that happi[G]ness
Is a miserable son of a [D]bitch [A]

Now the [Bm]kitchen's getting crowded
And the band is really loud
And there's a fat man
Saying he's my [A]friend
Well hey man is you're my [G]friend
Will you spot me a [D]drink? [A]

And the [Bm]couple in the corner
They're the reason why I hate
Rock and [A]roll
Cause rock and [G]roll
Is [D]dead it's [A]dead it's [Bm]dead

[Bm] [A] [G] [D] [A]

Well I [G]know you did not ask
But I've [D]got some comfort to offer
[A]Nothing very good or bad ever [Bm]lasts [A]

[Bm] [A] [G] [D] [A] [Bm]
