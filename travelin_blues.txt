Traveling Blues 
by Jimmie Rogers 
also recorded by Lefty Frizell 

C
I had a dream last night 
I thought my good gal had gone 
F
When I woke this morning 
C
She really had done me wrong 
G
I know it's not fair 
C
But my good gal has done caught air 

(Chorus) 
I'm going away leaving today 
I'm gonna bring my baby back 
If that eight wheel driver 
Don't jump the railroad track 
I'll take her from that man 
Gonna bring her home if I can

My gal's been trifflin round 
About a week I know 
Several of my friends 
Just told me so and so 
She's found a new man 
Now I can understand
(Chorus)

Well It's true my baby's gone 
I know it won't be long 
We'll both be on that train 
My baby's coming home again 
She's been trifflin' round 
But now she has turned him down 
(chorus)
