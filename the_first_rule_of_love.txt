The First Rule of Love
Capo 5th fret

Am

[C] You'll get [G] hooked you'll get [Am] drugged
[C] She'll be your [G] essence she'll be your [Am] blood
[C] You'll want her [G] more and more but you'll [F] never get enough
And [Am] that's the [Em] first rule of [Am] love

She'll smell so sweetly in the morning
She'll make you feel so good inside
And you'll want her so much you'll give everything else up
And that's the first rule of love

Am G F Am x2
Em G Am Em G Am

You'll grow comfortable together
You'll start to fit like hand in glove
And then you'll start to hate the men that she used to dream of
And that's the first rule of love

[F] You'll miss her [Am] madly [F] when you're [Am] apart
[Em] Love is like [G] gravity [F] holding down your heart

You'll grow envious and bitter
She'll be enquiring and concerned
And you'll feel so close to her but never close enough
To get past the first rule of love

And with the [C] awkwardness of [G] strangers you will [F] finally give up
No [Am] exceptions to the [Em] first rule of [Am] love
No exceptions to the first rule of love
