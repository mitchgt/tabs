"Canned Laughter" also has the same ambiance. The A2 and B2 chords are named that way because I do not know the exact name of the chord, but it's easy to remember the positioning. All you do when playing the E in the verses is slide that E chord to the A and B "barre" chord positioning respectively without changing the fingering. I hope it's not confusing J. also note that the intro chords are played slightly different than the verse chords throwing the E2 in instead of the A2 chord and the A/F# is only played in the first half of the intro.) (the chords are almost exact except the G# in the bridge. I can't tell exactly what variation it is, but it sounds best as a full barre chord)Intro:Eadd9   E   E2  B2   C#m  A/F#  BEadd9   E   E2  B2   C#m  A                      E      A2  B2   If you think your mind is ready                  C#m             A  Then open your heart and let it fall                 E          A2  B2   If you keep on hiding from me                     C#m             A  You're not gonna' live your life at all Chorus:                  E           C#m  Cause' if it's love that you want           A                           F#m  You've gotta' give me more than you've shown              G#m                          C#m   Because the sweet light of love won't come down               A             E     A  If you don't cry, cry to be found                             E     A  EIf you don't cry, cry to be found So get yourself together, let it Be something you'll treasure for evermore Make me come out lookin' for it And show me you're worth me waitin' for Cause' if it's love that you want You've gotta' give me more than you've shown Because the sweet light of love won't come down If you don't cry, cry to be found If you don't cry, cry to be found Bridge:                       C#m         A  If you could give me a flag to follow               G#                C#m   A bright shiny path toward your door                      F#m       Then you might get somewhere at last           AThat you wanted to go, ooh yeah Eadd9   E   E2  B2   C#m  A  Cause' if it's love that you want You've gotta' give me more than you've shown Because the sweet light of love won't come down If you don't cry, cry to be found If you don't cry, cry to be found Transcribed by Troy Heffelfingerwynterfire@lycos.com</PRE><CENTER><HR width=400><TABLE align="center"><TR>    <TD><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>				  <A HREF="Chords.htm"> |Chords|</A>                                  <A HREF="lyrics.htm"> |Lyrics|</A>				  <A HREF="submit.htm"> |Submit|</A>				  <A HREF="links.htm"> |Links|</A>				  <A HREF="index.html"> |Home|</A>				  				  <A HREF="news.htm"><font color="#CC0000">|News|</font></a>				  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>Web Site developed by <A HREF="me.htm"><IMG SRC="mylogo.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=30 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></A>(c) 1999.</TD></TR></TABLE></HTML>
