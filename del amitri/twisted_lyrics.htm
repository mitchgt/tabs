through the groaning stones You can see me tonight, I'll be shell shocked and white in the cold light of dawn But I ain't gonna cry just to give some guy Food for songs People going hungry, Stand like a sackfull of bones, People going hungry, feeding a billion homes So I put my dead child down, you put your TV on Well I ain't gonna cry just to give some guy Food for songs Yeah, there's people beating people, To keep the system strong People beating people, to keep the illusion going So I'm going to fight every day of my life 'til they're gone But I ain't gonna die just to give some guy Food for songs Yeah, there's people holding people, Making those wailing sounds, Yeah, there's people holding people, Watching them lower me down So I take my leave and you take what you see And you make it what you want But when I see you in hell, I will give you some Food for songs. </PRE><A NAME="start"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>start with me</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>With all the stuff they sell you night and day With all the trash they try to trick you with you lie to me Well I don't need it but I get it anyway With all the sadness and lunacy, With all the dispossessed hopeless, you're leaving me Well I don't want it but it's how it's going to be Yeah, you can try to save the world And baby, that's fine But is it such a hateful crime to start with me? With all the bad debts and misery With all the dirty tricks and hypocrites you cheat on me Well I don't want it but it's all that I can see With all the discrete obscenities With all the money freaks and doublespeak you turn away Well I don't need it, but I guess it's gonna stay Yeah, you can try to save the world Well baby, that's fine But is it such a hateful crime to start with me? </PRE><A NAME="here"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>here and now</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Hey I'm with you, let me just get you a light And if we'd thought to listen We might have checked if the weather was right And I don't mind if you want to drive all day Hey, it's raining, I should have brought my coat And sometimes I could sell my soul Just to sit and watch you smoke And I don't mind if you want to break my heart 'Cos you can burn paper You can turn a wheel But you can't change later Here and now just how good we can feel Hey, stop talking, think I can hear the sea And did I tell you the sound of the surf Makes strange things happen to me And I don't mind if you want to crash the car 'Cos you turn traitor You can turn on your heels But you can't change lady Here and now just how good we can feel And hey don't worry, so that black cat's some kind of curse 'Cos if bad times are coming up ahead, Just put us in reverse I don't want to waste time, thinking 'bout it here and now babe Nothing else matters but what we've got here and now babe. </PRE><A NAME="one"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>one thing left to do</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>So long, hope you dreams come true Now I've gone i know you're gonna bloom And did you want me to say I'd die for you What you wanted I couldn't give I guess I needed it to live And did you want me to say I'd die for you And did you want me to give my heart to you, Well I wanted to but I wasn't sure who I belonged to And so long to everything Now there's only one thing left to do, I guess I want to prove that I'd die for you I don't think of you, like I used to do, I can't figure who, I'm writing this to And it's OK if you want to say I died for you. </PRE><A NAME="tell"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>tell her this</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Tell her not to go I ain't holding on no more Tell her something in my mind freezes up from time to time Tell her not to cry I just got scared that's all Tell her I'll be by her side, all she has to do is call Tell her the chips are down I drank too much and shouted it aloud Tell her something in my heart Needs her more than even clowns need the laughter of the crowd Tell her what was wrong I sometimes think to much But say nothing at all And tell her from this high terrain, I am ready now to fall Tell her not to go I ain't holding on no more Tell her nothing if not this; all I want to do is kiss her Tell her something in my mind Freezes up from time to time.

beautiful empty shell, When you've shaken the hand of so many sinceroes You feel like a fake yourself How do you choose between you and me When we both feed on being somebody else So you suck on the juice of youth and use any chemical you can get You get deeper in debt every step you take on your ladder of lifelessness Bye bye to the boring times, Hello to my friend, how you been being somebody else? Now the troops in you head won't obey what you say And the mutiny seems to spread And all you can hear is a voice in your ear and it's telling you that you're dead The sun sets in a coffee cup, the moon throws up The flood flows over the house, The books start jumping from the shelf And the clothes horse races itself Now we're all so busy being somebody else. </PRE><A NAME="roll"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>roll to me</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Look around your world pretty baby Is it everything you hoped it'd be The wrong guy, the wrong situation The right time to roll to me Look into your heart pretty baby, Is it aching with some nameless need. Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it Right then, roll to me And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair So if you want to talk the night through Guess who will be there? So don't try to deny it pretty baby, You've been down so long you can hardly see When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining It's the right time to roll to me Look around your world pretty baby Is it everything you hoped it'd be The wrong guy, the wrong situation The right time to roll to me </PRE><A NAME="crashing"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>crashing down</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Well it might not be so important to you now When the night is young and everyone's around And the music flows Through your doped up Disney mind. But you'll be crying like a baby when it comes And you will try it anyway you can To find a place to run, 'cos it ain't no fun In party town, when loneliness comes crashing down And you'll be hurting in a way you can't explain And all those pretty things you love will look so vain 'Cos the laughing crowd is such a hopeless sound When loneliness comes crashing down And you might not thing about Just what happens now as your guests collect their coats. In an empty house full of ashtray doubts Your formless future floats So the bad and beautiful still remain With their depleted bounty of bad cocaine, we love the house But we can't quite place the name And it might not be important to you now, When the night is young and you are loose and loud 'Cos there ain't no sound in party town Quite like loneliness crashing down </PRE><A NAME="might"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>it might as well be you</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>There is nobody here tonight, who doesn't dance to the same tune as I Looking for that special someone new, and hey babe it might as well be you And as I fumble through my change, the dance floor illuminates And there you are again I'm looking for someone to hold on to And hey, babe, it might as well be you It might as well be you that I wake up to tomorrow And it might as well be you that tonight whispers my name And it might as well be you that I cling to, that I laugh with and sing to That I kiss good-bye to never see again And through the fog that love creates the night is filled with all the usual mistakes they say you're looking lonely babe, and they've been looking too And hey, they might well be for you And by the light of cigarettes, we introduce ourselves in a way you don't forget I'm looking for something and anything will do So, hey babe, it might as well be you And if we go home tonight, you might find the very thing That come the morning light, might well have washed your mind of him So let me in tonight so we two losers might start to win It might as well be you that I wake up to tomorrow And it might as well be you that tonight will call my name And it might as well be you that I cling to, that I laugh with and sing to Yeah babe, it might as well be you that reminds me It was once her here beside me That I kissed good-bye, to never see again </PRE><A NAME="enough"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>Never Enough</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>With two hundred people in suits all the same You walk off that last lonely train. On the half finished buildings only seagulls remain As you try to think back to the root of this pain And life ain't worth living without a little love But a little love is never enough So some folks are fighting for freedom, but you're just fighting the flab And therein lies the reason that life is a drag. So you gaze at the television As some publicity goons cut loose those useless balloons. Down in the darkness of your lying little heart There's a space for you to change So you can take this world apart. And these days the morning mirror seems to say to you now, That you used to be pretty but you're alright now. And sometimes you find you're dreaming as you're late for work again Thinking there's not many trees you can see from this train. Life ain't worth living Without a little love But a little love is never enough </PRE><A NAME="never"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>it's never too late to be alone</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Summer here is over in a million different ways You look like a dream sometimes, but I don't dream these days Yesterday the snow fell, by four o'clock it thawed And last night making love to you, well honey, it was such a fraud 'Cos you can find yourself a lover You can find yourself a home You can want no other ever But it's never too late to be alone So everything is settled or so we do pretend From a beautiful beginning babe to a muted kind of end And our separate possessions are shuffled up on shelves Like our fingers lock together when we talk about ourselves You can find yourself one day staring into space With a suitcase waiting by the door You can think you've got it made 'til it hits you in the face That these are not the people you want to be before Summer here is over, you can feel it in the air From the down-town shells to the upland hills The chill is everywhere </PRE><A NAME="driving"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>driving with the brakes on</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Driving through the long night Trying to figure who's right and who's wrong Now the kid has gone. I sit belted up tight, She sucks on a match light, glowing bronze, steering on. And I might be more of a man if I stopped this in it's tracks And said, come on, let's go home. But she's got the wheel, And I've got nothing except what I have on. When you're driving with the brakes on When you're swimming with your boots on, It's hard to say you love someone And it's hard to say you don't Trying to keep the mood right, trying to steer the conversation from The thing we've done. She shuts up the ashtray, and I say it's a long way back now hon She just yawns. And we might get lost someplace So desolate that no one where we're from would ever come But she's got the wheel and I've got to deal from now on. But unless the moon falls tonight, unless continents collide, Nothing's gonna make me, break from her side </PRE></HTML>
