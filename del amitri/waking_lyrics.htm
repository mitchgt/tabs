don't know why your feelings are changing but I've seen it in your face All those times when our lips were kissing our tongues were telling lies And all those signs that I've been missing were right there in your eyes. So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye. I sometimes feel when we're together baby, everything has turned out wrong and I know you feel exactly the same way but still we carry on. I've been waiting up by the window watching these cars go by And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions for the last time tonight. So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye. Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise I'm watching the light fade away And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door and you'll stand here and say Come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye Better make it sooner than later Before it all turns sour We'd better kiss this thing goodbye. </PRE><A NAME="opposite"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>opposite view</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>We could be away from here by ten o'clock tonight Pennies won't get us to heaven, I know but a borrowed car just might Look through my wallet There's enough for a hotel room But no, no, no, you say "I wanna stay in and get wet with you." Why do you take the opposite view? We could be different people tonight Who do you want to choose? I'll book a table in a suit and tie and you can wear your sister's shoes Look through my wallet Which cities shall we travel through? But no, no, no you say "You just got paid, Money's not for wasting it's for holding onto." Why do you take the opposite view? Is it something in your nature that makes it hard to say, "Baby, I do." You don't have to agree when someone says they love you But you don't have to take the opposite view We can walk on the roofs tonight and watch the midnight traffic flow Unscrew the lightbulbs babe, and we'll throw them from the 14th floor I say we're yellow if we don't do something new But you just laugh and start filling up my glass as if it's not true. Why do you take the opposite view? Every precious second there's a chance to change The present tense is perfect baby, Let's rearrange it. </PRE><A NAME="move"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>move away jimmy blue</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>A struck match faded like a nervous laugh Beyond the halo of a naked bulb Your low voice mingles with your other half's; Schoolfriends in second-hand clothes Eventually your world will shrink within four walls Of neglected debts and stolen stereos. So move away Jimmy Blue Before your small, small town turns around and swallows you A drunk mother was the cue For the legendary things that you do Behind a carnival tent with mud on your face Behind the old glue factory too. So move away Jimmy Blue Before your small, small town turns around and swallows you Wet feet visit the same old places Finding nothing new It's a binful of tissues from made-up faces In a townful of nothing to do A love match with the moon In a layby, while insects hum and You got put in the darkness of a woman's womb Jimmy Blue. So move away, yeh, Move away Jimmy Blue Before your small, small town Turns around and swallows you. </PRE><A

'Cos we're in love with time Whole generations thinking of themselves As infidels and pop stars While the bomb loses patience We line up and just lean against the bar Stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love. Caught in the headlights Wide-eyed and ready to receive We are the dead life Locked in dogfights, lost in disbelief And these dark days Make the nights seem brighter than they are So while Fleet Street rolls and the moon glows In the funhouse the fun starts Stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love. Born in the half-light Of threats and bribes In a hopeless porn parade We get the dog's life, tidbits train us What to wear, what not to say When you're footloose but you just feel limbless Life gets in the way So we get loaded or totally legless But stay the same Stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love. </PRE><A NAME="you're"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>you're gone</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>I turned on a T.V. station and Lip-read with the sound turned down It was Pro-Celeb mouth-to-mouth resuscitation With Esther Rantzen Playing the one who's drowned In a room next door a couple is fighting But isn't that just one of love's charms When moods change as fast as lightning And fifteen minutes later you're Lying in each other's arms And you're gone They say that it's better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all But if you sit down and count the cost of All those losses There's no profit at all This city gets crazy at Christmas Glitter guards the crucifix all over the place Its head gets too big for its body And its mouth gets Too big for its face And you're gone Never throw away an old newspaper Everyday's rich with its current accounts Prince visits Philippines and parliament debates it Back page, column five Somebody's wedding's announced Sunday night's the night for loving And squeezing out the weekend's last drops Sunday night's the night for forgiving maybe that's why They shut the shops And you're gone One day you wake up And all the pain you've given out gets returned But I'm not sorry now I've payed for what I've learned And you're gone I turned on a T.V. station and Lip-read with the sound turned down It was the Church of Christ playing the Price Is Right Where everybody starves While Leslie Crowther counts. </PRE><A NAME="when"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>when i want you</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>You sent greetings from Liverpool and I took the next train Passed by people putting flowers on graves and We got delayed When I arrived you had vanished like steam and left me in a diesel day So I walked around and spent ten pounds in amusement arcades Felt like I was in a field looking for a pin It's a kind of loneliness It's a kind of emptiness But I'm not trying I'm just rehearsing For the perfect day When I want you, I'll come looking for you Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will. I took a spoon to the swimming pool to drain your trace away And I changed my name so only my looks remain And if looks could kill I'd need a license for my face 'Cos where his fists put bruises A scheming smile now takes their place Felt like I was in a field looking for a pin It's a kind of loneliness It's a kind of emptiness But I'm not trying I'm just rehearsing For the perfect day When I want you, I'll come looking for you Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will. </PRE><A

'Cos trying to tell her lies from the truth at times Is like trying to divide ice from snow When I knew it was over, I jumped into a taxi And said, "Just guess where to go" And the driver turned about and said, "Finding what you want is like Trying to divide ice from snow" So here I sit, rolling back to bed Knowing love is a hazard That I'd never guessed But from this side of the morning I couldn't care less Nobody's helpless, although I've never felt this helpless before And trying to persuade myself not to think about her Is like trying to tell the clouds not to pour So I put down the bottle While in my head time is collapsing and the currents run cold So I can curse her memory But don't try telling me that she was not An emerald in a mountain of coal Or that there's a crock of cures for cancer at the end of the rainbow So here I sit, rolling back to bed Knowing love is a hazard That I'd never guessed But from this side of the morning I couldn't care less And she's the kind of girl who won't forgive But will forget So take me frome this party, driver, Put me back to bed I wanted to be loved but just got laughed at instead So if this taxi is for hire I'll get in the back Just to hear the friction of the tarmac and the tyres So nobody's perfect, and that's something that I'm sure she'll know And trying to persuade myself Not to think about her is like Trying to tell the cockerels not to crow Or like trying to tell the striker Not to think about the goal So here I sit, rolling back to bed Knowing love is a hazard That'd I'd never guessed But from this side of the morning I couldn't care less </PRE><A NAME="empty"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>empty</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Don't get so distressed If the good life won't arrive You've been reading S.O.S. When it's just your clock reading 5:05 And why are you so possessed By the thought that she got free And why are you figuring who's the best When just your luck ran out and she chose me We do not lie side by side and mock the thought of you And I don't take her hand and ask Is this what he used to do? 'Cos I just want to free her from Your jails of jealous dreams 'Cos at least a house when it's empty Stays clean I won't pretend That I was simply swayed It was a two way thing not a Three day fling No secrets kept, no truth betrayed And here's the house that held The nightmare that went on And you're sitting there wishing you'd never been born With that self-inflicted crown of thorns We do not lie side by side and mock the thought of you And I don't take her hand and ask Is this what he used to do? 'Cos I just want to free her from Your jails of jealous dreams 'Cos at least a house when it's empty Stays clean I won't pretend That I'm the saviour of the innocent and bad But put two withered old blooms in a couple of rooms And they'll behave like lunatics and crave what makes them sad So here's a card that says Happy twenty-second birthday and I wish you were dead And here's a house that held a bevy of devils and an angel as well And you want what I've got When all I've got is guilt And a room that won't stay still Filled with pockets full of crumpled up money and a mantelpiece littered with bills 'Cos at least a house when it's empty stays clean </PRE><A NAME="hatful"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>hatful of rain</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Lovehearts on an old stone building Have no relevance now Sherry bottles in a bus-stop litter bin Remind me of you somehow You look so young it's frightening Life's been good to you But strike me down with bolts of lightning If I wasn't good to you too Throw me away, throw me away again 'Cos I don't mind, I'm still satisfied With just a hatful of rain Merry widows in stock gloss magazines Dumbstruck open their mouths And out comes some old jackpot philosophy -- Everything must pay somehow And I've heard you say that he just works for me, Doing things that you can't do But grease my palms with a hatful of currencies I don't belong to you Throw me away, throw me away again 'Cos I don't mind, I'm still satisfied With just a hatful of rain </PRE><A NAME="nothing"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>nothing ever happens</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Post office clerks put up signs saying position closed And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats Janitors padlock the gates For security guards to patrol And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink While the married ones turn on a chat show And they'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow Gentlemen time please, you know we can't serve anymore Now the traffic lights change to stop, when there's nothing to go And by five o'clock everything's dead And every third car is a cab And ignorant people sleep in their beds Like the doped white mice in the college lab Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all The needle returns to the start of the song And we all sing along like before And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there The Martians could land in the carpark and no one would care Close-circuit cameras in department stores shoot the same movie every day And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed Just survive constant action replay Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all The needle returns to the start of the song And we all sing along like before And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow Bill hoardings advertise products that nobody needs While angry from Manchester writes to complain about All the repeats on T.V. And computer terminals report some gains On the values of copper and tin While American businessmen snap up Van Goghs For the price of a hospital wing Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all The needle returns to the start of the song And we all sing along like before Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all They'll burn down the synagogues at six o'clock And we'll all go along like before And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow </PRE></HTML>
