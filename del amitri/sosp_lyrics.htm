matter how you talk And some girls they are easy to be yourself with But the one girl that I want, ain't easy to please with what I've got With some girls it don't matter where you're aiming With some girls it don't matter how you act And some girls they don't care what car you came in But the one girl that I want, she wants that one bit of geography I lack Yeah, she don't want me 'cos I'm not where it's at And some girls they will worry about reactions And some girls they don't give a damn for that But somehow I ain't ever in on the action 'Cos the one girl I want, she wants that one little quality I lack Yeah, she don't want me 'cos I'm not where it's at I don't have my finger on the pulse of my generation I just got my hand on my heart, I know no better location </PRE><A NAME="some"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>some other suckers parade</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie / Mcloughlin)</FONT><PRE>I must've had a million damn unlucky days But there ain't no cloud that a bottle can't chase away I've done my deal of living, ran from place to place But when the roof comes in I don't wanna take it straight They say with faith any soul can make it But hell, why should I wait 'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade I've had my share of heartaches, let downs and tricks But the everyday blues is the one thing I can fix I've heard those holy brethren muttering my name But it ain't no sin to drink when you're suffering Patience, they say, is a saintly virtue But hell, why should I wait 'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade When every heavy sky just empties on your fate Sometimes keeping dry's something to celebrate So if the road of sin is the one I'm taking I ain't gonna stray 'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade </PRE><A NAME="won't"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>won't make it better</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie / Harvie)</FONT><PRE>So you say you are sick of love Got a mind to give the damn thing up Got a housefull of stuff your lovers left Gonna take a bus to the city dump with it So you want to throw away the old you But the old you's old enough to know It won't make it better Sick of being a loser, so you say Gonna go out and choose a new personality Ain't gonna look at her pictures, lie awake all night You're gonna dazzle the future with your inner light So you want to throw away the old you But the old you's old enough to know It won't make it better I've set out on that mission too A little revolution to forget her Trying to make it better </PRE><A NAME="what"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>what i think she sees</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>I've been in this place many times before With my baby's things among my shoes and strings and clothes But just because I'm here Don't mean I can't run out that door Ain't that what those running shoes are for? Baby likes to sleep on floor boards bare And just to keep the peace, well I join her there And she might say to me 'A better man I can't recall' But what I think she sees ain't me at all It ain't me at all to need somebody Like some lovestruck casualty It ain't me at all to feel so ready To be what I think she sees Baby claims I kiss like I really care Well, I guess I'd say I don't but the truth ain't fair And sometimes she looks at me and says 'Babe, my heart just stalled', But what I think she sees ain't me at all. </PRE><A NAME="medicine"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>medicine</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>You can find another country if you want Somewhere you can hide yourself away Find yourself another set of holes to haunt Get yourself another debt that you can't pay Yeah, you can try to run for cover everywhere Add another letter to your name Burn everything you ever used to wear Get yourself another lover that looks the same But sometimes it's the medicine itself that makes the pain Well, you can always make another move again Another set of keys, a different town And you can try to lose yourself in them 'Till the truth it catches up and cuts you down 'Cos sometimes it's the medicine itself that makes the pain And you can always hide the wreckage that you come from But every new disguise is just another lie to run from. You can only try to fool yourself so long With any kind of measure you can find 'Cos every phony pleasure you've been on Has lifted off and left the pain behind. 'Cos sometimes it's the medicine itself that makes the pain </PRE><A NAME="high"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>high times</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie / Harvie)</FONT><PRE>Little snow white, she is sleeping 24 hours a day She's got a right to be lazy, flat out of reasons to breathe And it's cold baby, yes it's cold But everything is relative can't you see we're living in High times, dig the new domain Living through high times, just don't crash my spiritual plane Little snow white, she was hungry Told to go out and graft for it At the end of the rainbow she was mind blown To be staring at a crock of shit And it's hard baby, yes it's hard But with a little intuition you can shift position in the High times, touch the magic stone Living through high times, pick up that spiritual phone. Frittering packs of refuseniks, too drunk to muster any contempt 10 ways to relax on a cruise ship, one way to cover the rent I've whored myself around enough to know, baby You don't come with the customers and smile when you're spoken to in High times, catch the cosmic vibe. Living through high times, hey, has Ginger Baker died? Living through high times, my planet's all out of line Living through high times, man, just like '69 </PRE><A NAME="mother"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>mother nature's writing</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie / Harvie)</FONT><PRE>Open up your eyes, Everything is crying out this could be your time She fell out of the sky, Must every star been working on Heavenly designs A crooked line of lightning, a silent movie moon Mother nature's writing to you So button up your lip You don't get many chances in the time between the tides. The weather's rolling in In a minute flat you'll be soaking wet So kiss her while it's dry A crooked line of lightning, a silent movie moon Mother nature's writing to you </PRE><A NAME="no"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>no family man</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Well, I talk like a boy to my baby sometimes And you talk like a baby when your boy is crying You made something to love but I love what I am No family man So don't tell me you've got something better than me Don't say that it's a great mystery It's just making love what you want it to be, That's why I am no family man And that is why all that I have in the world Is an ocean of time with this beautiful girl Have you got something to prove with your own little you Have I wasted my time, cut through the family line In the race to life, I am an also-ran But I've run enough to know I'm no family man. Yeah I've done enough to know I'm no family man. </PRE><A NAME="cruel"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>cruel light of day</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Someone's opening up for business The morning rings the same old way But someone should've taught me forgiveness Now I see it in the cruel light of day Tell him he's done me a kindness She was going to leave anyway But love is such sweet blindness 'Til you see it in the cruel light of day Last night was just a comedy And I woke up like a walking tragedy And it was right in front of me But I just laughed and turned my eyes away. So pour me another cup of coffee I ain't ever seen the city look so grey And those pretty little diamonds in the darkness They ain't no jewels in the cruel light of day. No I ain't some accessory She can slip off from her back and just fold away I don't need no one undressing me When I wake up in the same suit everyday. So someone's opening up for business The shutters roll so familiarly And out of darkness comes relief sing the witless But I don't see it in the cruel light of day. </PRE><A NAME="funny"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>funny way to win</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie / Harvie)</FONT><PRE>So you want me to play the bleeding role Just so he can know how I needed you. Well that's okay with me, it's a part I think I know God knows he won't need to suspend belief. I know it's just a game and losing you's How it just begins...ain't that a funny way to win So I run around dragging people down Holding my broken heart like a cheap cartoon Just so he can see it's a sucker who Does to you what you did to me I know it's just a game and losing you's How it just begins...ain't that a funny way to win So if there's another need that I can still serve I'm low on self esteem but I'm high on nerve </PRE><A NAME="through"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>through all that nothing</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie / Harvie)</FONT><PRE>Honey, sometimes those big blue eyes Can make me fall out of bed in surprise In the bright morning sun, In the howling wind, in the shirt you sleep in, You're the one 'Cos it's you, that I tried to find Every day and every night through all that nothing The hands of fate, couldn't have done it all As if the rain ever cared where it falls And there were times when I know that I Just fell in love to give myself an alibi. 'Cos it's you I was waiting for Every day and every night through all that nothing So it's true now, I can see All that nothing that I knew Was so something like you'd Come to me... Through all that nothing. </PRE><A NAME="life"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>life is full</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>People say you are a stand up guy You'd never hurt no one and you'd never try And you laugh and you cry And you do all the things that anybody does to show they are alive. Friends say you are a careful man You always favour reason where you can And you laugh and you cry And you do all the things that anybody does to show they are alive. But wherever you go, whatever you do You know that they won't find a fool quite like you. Yeah life is full (of easy choices) Yeah life is full (of simple rules) But when love comes you don't have no room When life is full. People say you are a patient guy You'd never rush something if it ain't right And you make those mistakes that everybody does And you deal with them as you go From tripping on a shoelace to falling in love You keep things under control </PRE><A NAME="lucky"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>lucky guy</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie / Harvie)</FONT><PRE>Baby, hold it, just let me try For just one minute be this other guy Live his life With my home and my faithful wife And your pretty face to kiss some nights Ain't I a lucky guy, I get what I want Ain't I a lucky guy, unlucky for some. Baby, I like it, it feels alright Now that I see it through his cheating eyes I can't stop smiling How could I not be satisfied So glad I ain't the one on the losing side Ain't I a lucky guy, I get what I want Ain't I a lucky guy, unlucky for some. No need to feel guilty baby I'm happy to be The one that you come to babe, instead of me So I don't know where tonight Love will lead me but that's alright 'cos Ain't I a lucky guy, I get what I want Ain't I a lucky guy, unlucky for some. </PRE><A NAME="make"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>make it always be too late</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>What I want is everything to clear So let the clocks be wrong Let the evening be longer let me drown in here What I want gets clouded by the sun I can't see beyond The petty things that living here brings everyone. So get lost with me, let the whole world wait Make it always be too late What I want is right before my eyes So set me up a drink Pull the shutters down on all those prying satellites 'Cos what I want is everything to be clear So if you stop your watch You might stop the morning's cruel hammer falling here So get lost with me, let the whole world wait Make it always be too late </PRE></HTML>
