To me they sound pretty spot on (except maybe one or two ·If your not playing with the song·you'll be hard pressed to notice). I'm not a music scholar so the chords I didn't know the exact name for I put a number behind it. This is a rather beautiful·but far too short song. I hope the guitar transcription is enjoyable.The C chord just before the Cm chord in the chorus should be played as a barre chord (x35553) to sound rightintro:G   Em*   x2G                     A*   she's passing this way                          Em*   Em7*          A2*                                        and if your looking for love, she'll give it awayG                               A*                                                        yeh, we've all drunk from that cup                      Em*      Em7*          you'll be hooked within minutes            A2*                                                                                                     of tasting a dropchorus       G               D/F#        C/G       cos she is something that is true       G           D/F#                    C/G       but just a kiss my friend, you're through                Em*                                              cos when she walks and leaves you blue     A3                 C          Cmyou'll look like the junkies standing here in front of youbut hey, you should follow your heartmaybe she won't desire youfor just pulling apartand I don't care if she doesonce she's got you in deeperthere'll be one more of uschoruscos she is something that is truebut just a kiss my friend, you're throughcos when she walks and leaves you blueyou'll look like the junkies standing here in front of youTranscribed by Troy Heffelfinger(wynterfire@hotmail.com)</PRE><CENTER><HR width=400><TABLE align="center"><TR>    <TD><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>				  <A HREF="Chords.htm"> |Chords|</A>                                  <A HREF="lyrics.htm"> |Lyrics|</A>				  <A HREF="submit.htm"> |Submit|</A>				  <A HREF="links.htm"> |Links|</A>				  <A HREF="index.html"> |Home|</A>				  				  <A HREF="news.htm"><font color="#CC0000">|News|</font></a>				  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>Web Site developed by <A HREF="me.htm"><IMG SRC="mylogo.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=30 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></A>(c) 1999.</TD></TR></TABLE></HTML>
