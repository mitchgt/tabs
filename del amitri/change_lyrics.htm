feelings show And twenty miles away she waits alone for me But when I try to picture her you're the one I see And in another situation I could put up a fight But you will be my downfall tonight So the night is coming down, drowning us in blue And it all points towards the things we know we shouldn't do And as I look at you and I fall under your spell Well I know I should be thinking of her lying there herself And when faced with temptation you know a man should stand and fight But you will be my downfall tonight Be my downfall be my great regret be the one girl That I'll never forget Be my undoing be my slow road to ruin tonight So the bus is pulling out and I'm grounded here with you And I want to say the sweet things babe I've always wanted to So tell me now the tail-lights have gone out of sight Baby won't you be my downfall once again tonight </PRE><A NAME="just"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>just like a man</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Well I spend my night times drinking and you spend your days in bed And I guess it's up to us to choose the methods by which we forget And just like a man he holds you gently And just like a man he strokes your hair And just like a man I still pretend that I'm Immune to the whole affair But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you I was wrong Yeh I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late So I soldier on just like a man I don't believe it, you were easy to leave but now I do my best to relieve it the only way I know how Just like a man And I don't wanna possess you, I don't wanna take his place But I don't wanna see my last few pleasures written all over his face And just like a man he holds you gently And just like a man he strokes your hair And just like a man I still pretend that I'm Immune to the whole affair But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you I was wrong Yeh I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late So I soldier on just like a man And I have something to tell you but it doesn't matter now I'll stick to small talk and leave the little bits of flattery to him And I could call you but why would I bother to You might not be in or he might misunderstand Just like a man </PRE><A NAME="when"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>when you were young</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Look at the fool you have been They drained the pool while you drowned in the dream They bought your beauty and your soul Then softly sold you back what they stole So look into the mirror do you recognise someone Is it who you always hoped you would become When you were young The disappointment of success Hangs from your shoulders like a hand-me down dress And down nostalgia's rocky road You watch your former lovers growing old So look into the mirror do you recognise someone Is it who you always hoped you would become When you were young Sometimes your lack of sympathy gets hard to explain So on your mask of make up just paint A little parody of pain So I look into the mirror and I recognise someone It is who you always hoped you would become When you were young </PRE><A NAME="surface"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>surface of the moon</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Snow in a soulless city covers up the cracks in the road As a wastrel buys her cigarettes and wipes her pretty nose Like a part-time Elvis imitator these streets I knew so well Have been pasted beyond recognition with a temporary smell Now the midnight train eases out leaving everyone marooned And without her it might as well be the surface of the moon From the well-swept streets of Jackson Heights to the dockside drudgery Everything's now a replica of what it used to be And since they tarted up the trenches and painted the bridges blue It seems less like a home to me than just a place they bury you Now we're lit up like a cathedral in our frozen concrete ruin And without her it might as well be the surface of the moon So I need her and I love her that is true But I'm stuck here like some shipwreck still holding on to you So when they beat out the tramps and patch up the slums Everything will be fine There'll be a new facade for us to hide behind So on the ancient trails of our coupling in the places we used to meet I am amazed by the lack of memories that I thought would flood through me And the riverside where we first kissed has now been reduced To a phoney old world market where only shoppers get seduced Now your arms embrace me strangely in your unfamiliar room And for all I care it might as well be the surface of the moon Yeh for all I care it might as well be the surface of the moon </PRE><A NAME="won't"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>i won't take the blame</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Daylight comes with such surprising speed Yesterday you talked of love and now you want to leave But don't expect me to stand in your way I am powerless to alter any action you might take And I won't take the blame I was not the one who played the joker in this game I was not the one who feels nothing anymore So if you walk out that door, I won't take the blame And as I look at the girl I once adored You tell me that I hold you back you tell me that you're bored So like a pair of clowns we stand around and fight Why can't you get it over with and walk out of my life? And I won't take the blame I was not the one who played the joker in this game I was not the one who feels nothing anymore So if you walk out that door, I won't take the blame And the steps of this old church are peppered with confetti hearts Like a million little love affairs waiting to fall apart </PRE><A NAME="first"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>the first rule of love</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>You'll get hooked, you'll get drugged She'll be your essence she'll be your blood And you'll want her so much but you'll never get enough And that's the first rule of love She'll smell so sweetly in the morning She'll make you feel so good inside And you'll want her so much you'll give everything else up And that's the first rule of love You'll grow comfortable together You'll start to fit like hand and glove And then you'll start to hate the men she used to dream of And that's the first rule of love You'll miss her madly, when you're apart Love is like gravity holding down your heart You'll grow envious and bitter She'll be enquiring and concerned And you'll feel so close to her but never close enough To get past the first rule of love And with the awkwardness of strangers You will finally give up No exceptions to the first rule of love </PRE><A NAME="ones"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>the ones that you love lead you nowhere</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Go and tell your mother, go and tell your friends You've been fooled again He appeared like magic and he left you on a late night train Yeh, some things never change Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere Yeh baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere If you could just be patient, pretty soon you would forget his name And face this world again If you could just stop looking for someone special You might save yourself some pain Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere Yeh baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere Every little lie makes you look so dumb They tell you nobody has ever come as close as you've come So baby tonight you've got the right to feel so numb Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere Yeh baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere </PRE><A NAME="always"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>always the last to know</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>o you're in love with someone else Someone who burns within your soul And it looks like I'm the last to know I hear you've never felt so alive So much desire beyond control And as usual I am the last to know The last to know how you're feeling The last to know where you are The last to know if you're happy now Or if he's treating you like I treated you Or if he's cruel I'll be the last to know We spent summers up beyond the bay And you said these are such perfect days That if the bomb drops baby, I want to be the last to know But now you're living up behind the hill And though we share the same city and feel the same sun When your winter comes I'll be the last to know Always the last to know how you're feeling The last to know where you are The last to know if you're happy now Or if he's pleading with you like I pleaded with you If you go don't let me be the last to know Don't let me be the last To know Creation's gone crazy, the TV's gone mad Now you're the only sane thing that I have The last to know how you're feeling The last to know where you are The last to know if you're happy now Or if he's cheating on you like I cheated on you And you were the last to know </PRE><A NAME="last"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>to last a lifetime</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>Roll down the window, let me hear the rain Let me hear her whispering, honey everything is OK Cos I've had enough bad news To last a lifetime Well I drove all night under a seasick sky And I made it by mid-afternoon And I hope she's home so she can hold me tight and tell me Everything is alright Cos I've had enough bad news To last a lifetime And I was struck by how much I remembered And how everything still looked the same When a neighbour I met in her hallway said "Looks like loverboy's too late again" So take your troublesome baggage And put it on the last train home Cos you can guess somewhere else in the world right now Someone else feels just as alone Cos I've had enough bad news To last a lifetime </PRE><A NAME="soon"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>as soon as the tide comes in</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>You'd better get some sleep for a change Before tomorrow brings you down By three o'clock they'll both be sitting on that plane Hopelessly honeymoon bound And I hope no one asks you to kiss this bride Or tie tin cans to the car And if friends and relations mingle outside You can linger at the bar So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon Let the action begin You'll feel like some soap opera star Predictably hitting the booze With your standard issue broken heart You step into your Saturday shoes And you might feel better if you slapped her face Or slipped some pills in his wine But instead some voice in your head keeps saying You'll look back and laugh sometime So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon Let the action begin Cos it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time The bride will be changing and you will be crying And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in So put on your lipstick and check that you hat's straight too Cos if they can go through with it you can do it too So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon Let the action begin Cos it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time The bride will be changing and you will be crying And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in</PRE><A NAME="behind"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>behind the fool</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>on't tell her that you want her Don't ask her to be yours Don't tell her she is everything Or she might see the fool behind the frown And then the heart behind the fool Don't tell her that you need her Don't tell her that you care Don't ask her to hold you Or she might see the fool behind the frown And then the heart behind the fool Behind the cool, there's a dreading that Someday she'll betray you Someday she will dispose of All her photographs of you So don't tell her when you're lonely Don't tell her when you're blue Don't tell her she means everything to you So don't tell her that you need her Don't tell her that you care Don't ask her to hold you Or she might see the fool behind the frown And then the heart behind the fool </PRE><A NAME="sometimes"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>sometimes I just have to say your name</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>With the sweet drip of every raindrop Time brings you closer to me And with each new sign at every train-stop Another hour without you is consigned to history And with each tick of my alarm clock I get crazy for the days to get to you When I can hold you and kiss you and have you Instead of staring at some photo like a fool But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight When I think that I might not make it through But honey sometimes I just have to say your name To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name So this morning I picked up the paper In the useless descent of the rain While partners in heartbreak the whole world over Lie and cheat just the same And the headlines proclaim everything has changed Love can't save you now As each little motion of my writswatch Holds up my faith somehow But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight When I think that I might not make it through But honey sometimes I just have to say your name To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name When I've used up all my patience When your letters have been read twenty times through I can drink all the wine in this place of mine But it ain't no replacement It ain't no replacement for you </PRE></HTML>
