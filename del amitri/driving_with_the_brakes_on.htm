I sit belted up tight.                                    Am            She sucks on a match light, glowing bronze, steering on.      F                        GAnd I might be more a man if I stopped this in it's tracks              Am           C         FAnd said come on, let's go home. But she's got the wheel.    G                                   Am     FAnd I've got nothing except what I have on.CHORUS:                              CWhen you're driving with the brakes on.                                 AmWhen you're swimming with you're boots on.                            F             GIt's hard to say you love someone                                Am      FAnd it's hard to say you don't.Trying to keep the mood right, trying to steer the conversation fromThe thing we've done.She shuts up the ashtray and I say it's a long way back now honAnd she just yawns. And we might get lost someplaceSo desolate that no one where we're from would ever comeBut she's got the wheel and I've got to deal from now on.When you're driving with the brakes on.When you're swimming with you're boots on.It's hard to say you love someoneAnd it's hard to say you don't.                  C             Am   F                  Am    F    CBut unless the moon falls tonight,   unless continents collide.                Am     F    G            Am     F    GNothing's gonna make me  break from her side.                             CWhen you're driving with the brakes on.                                 AmWhen you're swimming with you're boots on.                           F             GIt's hard to say you love someone                         Am           F    GAnd it's hard to say you don't.                           F            GIt's hard to say you love someone                               Am        F  CAnd it's hard to say you don't.</PRE><CENTER><HR width=400><TABLE align="center"><TR>    <TD><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>				  <A HREF="Chords.htm"> |Chords|</A>                                  <A HREF="lyrics.htm"> |Lyrics|</A>				  <A HREF="submit.htm"> |Submit|</A>				  <A HREF="links.htm"> |Links|</A>				  <A HREF="index.html"> |Home|</A>				  				  <A HREF="news.htm"><font color="#CC0000">|News|</font></a>				  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>Web Site developed by <A HREF="me.htm"><IMG SRC="mylogo.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=30 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></A>(c) 1999.</TD></TR></TABLE></HTML>
