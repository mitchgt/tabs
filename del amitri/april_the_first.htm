This also happens at the end of the bridge with the G chord (oscilating the F# and Gbass notes) and the C chord (at half the intervals of the G chord before it with the B and C bass notes)F   I woke up to bells this morning, I woke up to birds                       Dm                        BbI woke up to someone yawning and that yawn was hers FI was dreaming of a scene where all my life was cursed                                  Dm                      BbBy the Law of Love which states that things will just get worse Chorus:         C                                  Bb               Dm  When she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt           C                     FI thought it must be April the First I put my hand upon my heart and swear I never leave That she wanted love not just a room she could come to I recall her asking me what I was born to do I said, "There's no place for me, I'm simply passing through" When she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt I thought it must be April the First Bridge:      G            Am       C                GAnd by the Law of Averages, this won't last long G                F         Am             GBy the look of happiness, she'll soon be gone G           Am              C              G   But by the looks of things, I could be wrong              CI could be wrong So we went down to Glittertown and bought ourselves a ring When she announced that now she was in love with everything But I could not unlock the pessimism in my soul Surely scenes disasterly and rings and things get sold When she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt I thought it must be April the First And by the Law of Averages, this won't last long By the look of happiness, she'll soon be gone But by the looks of things, I could be wrong I could be wrong I woke up to bells this morning, I woke up to birds I woke up to someone yawning and that yawn was hers I was dreaming of a scene where all my life was cursed By the Law of Love which states that things will just get worse When she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt Yah when she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt Well she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt I thought it must be April the First Transcribed by Troy Heffelfingerwynterfire@lycos.com</PRE><CENTER><HR width=400><TABLE align="center"><TR>    <TD><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>				  <A HREF="Chords.htm"> |Chords|</A>                                  <A HREF="lyrics.htm"> |Lyrics|</A>				  <A HREF="submit.htm"> |Submit|</A>				  <A HREF="links.htm"> |Links|</A>				  <A HREF="index.html"> |Home|</A>				  				  <A HREF="news.htm"><font color="#CC0000">|News|</font></a>				  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>Web Site developed by <A HREF="me.htm"><IMG SRC="mylogo.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=30 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></A>(c) 1999.</TD></TR></TABLE></HTML>
