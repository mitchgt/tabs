babe, and say I'm still the one Just who are we trying to defend A burnt-out building should be condemned Baby, I don't even know you anymore, do I? Don't look forlorn, don't look so sad Deep down you know I was always bad You say, "I don't know even know you anymore (baby) I don't even know if I'm sure what I want" Maybe a better man could understand Maybe a better man could be your friend Maybe a better man who would hold you Like I'll never really hold you Maybe he could love you so that baby, I may be a better man Yes I know, things have changed Once we were lovers, now we ain't even friends And maybe love, don't ask me why, Is something for which I ain't qualified You say, "I can't even see the boy you were (baby) And I don't think it's good to even be here anymore" Maybe a better man could understand Maybe a better man could be your friend Maybe a better man could hold you like I'll never really hold you Maybe he could love you so that baby, I may be a better man Maybe a better man could be your friend Maybe a better man could understand Maybe a better man wouldn't leave you Wouldn't hurt you and deceive you Wouldn't leave you to believe that someday he may be a better man Would be your friend And understand so that you'd never need again A better man A better man A better man </PRE><A NAME="grimace"><FONT FACE="Arial"

the road to hope is open We can all be satisfied That the dream that's lying broken Can now just be denied There's a spirit in the country There's a face to fit that pride And the mandarins

one ever shows me the proof And when you hear the thunder growing louder than the rain They'll tell you it's an angel on the roof Maybe I'm not meant to question How it is that this has come to be The dream that I built at his suggestion Has completely failed as far as I can see Now all the true believers say that she'll come back again But no one ever shows me the proof And when you hear the thunder growing louder than the rain They'll tell you it's an angel on the roof And signs say call on Jesus, save yourself from sin But right now I'd rather have a hangover than have to talk to him Maybe I don't know the answer Maybe now someday I shall be saved But since he took her from this bed and blessed her I see nothing but a mattress and a grave Now all the true believers say that she'll come back again But no one ever shows me the proof And when you hear the thunder growing louder than the rain They'll tell you it's an angel on the roof They'll tell you it's an angel on the roof </PRE><A NAME="another"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>another letter home</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>(Currie)</FONT><PRE>There's a true blue moon in the black city sky But it looks white as an eyeball from here And I wonder tonight, does it look white from where you are too? And so far every morning, I wake up missing you The sweat in my T-shirts and dust in my shoes Reminds me that paradise is only a point of view You know, everybody here seems to be sleepwalking And pretending that they're free But they are all owned by Coca-Cola and maintained by vitamin C And there's freak shows and strip shows and theme parks and all those Standard distractions and curiosities So I smile at strangers like this is the place to be But if you took away the sunshine, dirt would be all you'd see And someone should tell me how to stop feeling small Between sky-scraping offices and 20 ft Marlboros The squeeze of a hand suggests love but first "How do you do?" And it's all so sincere here it just seems insane Last night somebody told me that there's two ways to bane: you can kill someone or you can dress up and change your name And you can be a has-been without having been anything But the light relief at the end of the news when the hill of things you've thrown away Is bigger than the things you've used But they say you can still see your face in the polish on the President's shoes So everyone's laughing and living in style The bill for the dentist as big as the smile I open my eyes and toothpaste is all I see You know, everyone's so friendly here they just postponed WW3 </PRE><A NAME="april"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=6><B>april the first</B></A></FONT><BR><FONT FACE="Arial"

Law of Love which states that things will just get worse When she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt I thought it must be April the First I put my hand upon my heart and swear I never leave That she wanted love not just a room she could come to I recall her asking me what I was born to do I said, "There's no place for me, I'm simply passing through" When she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt I thought it must be April the First And by the Law of Averages, this won't last long By the look of happiness, she'll soon be gone But by the looks of things, I could be wrong I could be wrong So we went down to Glittertown and bought ourselves a ring When she announced that now she was in love with everything But I could not unlock the pessimism in my soul Surely scenes disasterly and rings and things get sold When she turned 'round and said she loved me so much that it hurt I thought it must be April the First And

they walk on the bright side of the street And the city it shines in surprise in the ice cream heat And I want to be kissed in the haze of this hotel room Before the evening steals the afternoon And the traffic it shakes as my travel shaver drones And the maid she mistakes my 'come in' for a 'please leave me alone' But I want to be held in the swell of her sweet perfume Before the evening steals the afternoon Before the daylight dies and the dusty sky gets rusted up with tungsten Before the phony night stakes its claim on walkers waiting at the junction From the blue shade of the park, couples emerge Dropping hands like they're still scared to get caught But I want to be caught in their rage of embraces too Before the evening steals the afternoon </PRE><A

quiet In la Brisa de la Palma A teenage Rasputin takes the sting from a gin "When a woman learns to walk she's not dependent anymore" A line from a letter, May 24 And out on the bay the current is strong A boat can go lost But I didn't know someone could be so lonesome Didn't know a heart could be tied up and held for ransom So take your shoes and go outside Stride over stride Walk to that tide 'Cause the door is open wide Turned the fan off and went for a walk by the lights down on Shield Street The birds in the trees open their wings and he goes home again He dreams resistance, they talk commitment Things change over long distance Took the shirt from his back and the eyes from his head And left him for dead But I didn't know someone could be so lonesome Didn't know a heart could be tied up and held for ransom So take your shoes and go outside Stride over stride Walk to that tide Because the door is open wide They took pride They took your
