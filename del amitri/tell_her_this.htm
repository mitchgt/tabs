It sounds like that's what Justin does on the record. Also try taking off your 4th (little) finger from Chord 2 during the last "down-up-down" strums, in the verses.----------Tell Her This Capo 6th fretTuning DADGAD (see above)Numbers refer to Chords used (See above)Played in a fast 3/4  Intro1  /  2  /  3  /1  /  2  /  3  /  Verse One4  /    5 / 6    /   /    /   Tell her   not to go,4  /   5 /      6    /    /    /   I ain't  holding on no more,7 /     8     /  7      Tell her something in my mind,   /   8    /        1   /  2  /  3  /  /  /  1  /  2  /  3  /  /  /   Freezes up from time to time.  Verse Two4  /    5  / 6  /    /   /   Tell her  not to cry,4    / 5  /   6      /  /    /    I just   got scared that's all,7  /    8   /   7     Tell her I'll be by her side,   /    8    1   /    2   /     All she has to do is call.3    /    /   /  1 /   2   /   3   /   /   /   All she has to do is call.  Verse Three4  /    5  /   6    /  /  /   Tell her   the chips are down,4  / 5    /     6     /   /   /       I drank too much and shouted it aloud,7  /     8     /  7     Tell her something in my heart,    /      8     /   1   /    2     /  3    /   /   /    Needs her more than even clowns need the laughter of the crowd.  Verse Four4   /    5  /   6    /    /  /    Tell her   what was wrong.4     /    5   /    6  /     /     /        I sometimes think too much but say nothing at all.7  /      8   /   7      Tell her from this high terrain,     /   8  /   1  /    2    /    3     I am ready now to fall.     /   /  /    1    /  2    /    3   /  /  /     I am ready now to fall.  Verse Five4   /  5  / 6    /  /    /        Tell her    not to go.4   /  5   /    6    /   /     /   I ain't    holding on no more.7    /    8    /    7    Tell her nothing if not this,    /  8    /    1  /    2   /    3  /  /  /    All I want to do is kiss her.  Coda7   /    8     /  7       Tell her something in my mind,    /   8    /    1   /  2   /    1    /  1 (stop)    Freezes up from time to time. </PRE><P>Transcribed by <A HREF="mailto:paul@pahancock.freeserve.co.uk">Paul Hancock</A><P><CENTER><HR width=400><TABLE align="center"><TR>    <TD><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>				  <A HREF="Chords.htm"> |Chords|</A>                                  <A HREF="lyrics.htm"> |Lyrics|</A>				  <A HREF="submit.htm"> |Submit|</A>				  <A HREF="links.htm"> |Links|</A>				  <A HREF="index.html"> |Home|</A>				  				  <A HREF="news.htm"><font color="#CC0000">|News|</font></a>				  </FONT></TD></TR><TR><TD align="center"><FONT FACE="Letter Gothic" SIZE=2>Web Site developed by <A HREF="me.htm"><IMG SRC="mylogo.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=30 ALIGN=ABSCENTER></A>(c) 1999.</TD></TR></TABLE></HTML>
