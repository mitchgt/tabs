Yule Tide Me Over

I may never take you home to meet the family
Or wait to see you walking down the wedding aisle
We can’t know exactly where we’ll be next Christmas time
But darling yule tide me over for a while

I don’t often go to places on this side of town
And I’m not often looking for a chance to dance
But the end of the year is drawing near my dear
It’s almost Christmas and I’m ready for romance

Don’t try to fool me with disinterested looks
If it’s not right I guess we’re old enough to know
Let’s try to get to know each other better than we do
And spend the holidays beneath the mistletoe

I may never take you home to meet the family
Or wait to see you walking down the wedding aisle
This could turn into an everlasting love but as for now
Honey yule tide me over for a while
And I will tide you over for a while

There’s nothing wrong with snatching solace from despair
With no apologies we both have much to share
I’d grab this moment now to be your one and only
It’s late December there’s too many people lonely

Yule tide me over baby
Yule tide me over honey
Yule tide me over for a while

About a week ago my love walked out on me
Don’t even try to hide the sadness in your eyes
But still a stack of presents for her underneath the tree
But you’re as beautiful and just about her size

I may never take you home to meet the family
Or wait to see you walking down the wedding aisle
We can’t know exactly where we’ll be next Christmas time
But darling yule tide me over for a while

Yule tide me over for a while
And I’ll tide you over for a while
Yule tide me over honey
Yule tide me over  darling
Yule tide me over for a while
And I’ll tide you over and that’s fine
