Roll down the window, let me hear the rain 
E                A                E     B      A
Let me hear her whispering, honey everything is OK

Cos I've had enough bad news 
C#m   B       A
To last a lifetime 


Well I drove all night under a seasick sky 
And I made it by mid-afternoon 
And I hope she's home so she can hold me tight and tell me 
Everything is alright 


E         B     A

Intrumental
E B A


And I was struck by how much I remembered 
And how everything still looked the same 
When a neighbour I met in her hallway said 
"Looks like loverboy's too late again" 

    C#m                  F#m(7) 
So take your troublesome baggage 
     A                       C#m 
And put it on the last train home 
             E                            F#m 
Cos you can guess somewhere else in the world right now 
          A                   B
Someone else feels just as alone 

Cos I've had enough bad news 
To last a lifetime
