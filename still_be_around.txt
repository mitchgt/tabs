Capo 2nd fret

Verse 1:
G           D               A
I don't see you through the windshield,
G           D            A
I don't see you in faces lookin' back at me.
G               D              A         D
Alcohol doesn't have much that matters to say,
    G             D       A               D
And imagine where you and time to kill will stay.

Chorus:
       G          D            A                 D
When the bible is a bottle and a hardwood floor is home,
     G             D              A
When mornin' comes twice a day or not at all.
     G        D            A           D
If I break in two will you put me back together,
          G                D            A         F# G  E
When this puzzle's figured out will you still be around.

     F#             G
Say you've just been there,
E          Bm              G
Walking the line, upside down.

Verse 2:
Walked and breathed many a cancerous mile,
With a bat of an eye too slow to beat the coffin.
They won't tell it on the TV, they can't say it on the radio,
They pay to move it off the shelf and into our minds,
Til you can't tell the truth when it's right in front of your eyes.

Chorus, etc

--
One thing to keep in mind when playing this one is that you just about
want to take your ring finger and glue it to the B string on the fifth
fret 'cuz it will be there for every chord during the whole song (except
for the B Minor which should be played like a regular Bminor bar chord).

The F# G E at the end of the chorus kind of runs from one chord to
the other- I'm not sure of a better way to explain it other than to
listen to the song.
