"Rose Connelly" (Traditional)
From: "Sings Like Hell" (1994 - Vanguard Records)
By: Peter Case
Chords by: Tabbedout

This is a PD song, I have a live recording of Jeff Tweedy doing it, his version is called "Down In The Willow Garden".. I don't know who's right when it comes to the orignial song title.. but it's a great song anyway..

Capo 2nd fret.

1.Verse:

Down [C]in the willow gar[Am]den
My [C]love and I did [Am]meet
And [C]there we sat a court[Am]ing
My [C]love dropped [G]off to [C]sleep
I [Am]had a bottle of [C]burgundy [Am]wine
My [C]young love did not [Am]know
And [C]there I poisoned that dear little [Am]girl
Down [C]on the [G]banks be[C]low

2.Verse:

I drew my saber through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river
It was a dreadful sight
My father often told me
That money would set me free
If I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly

3.Verse:

And now he sits in his own cabin door
A-wiping his tear-brimmed eye
A-looking at his only son
On yonder scaffold high
My race is run beneath the sun
The devil is waiting for me
For I did murder that dear little girl
Whose name was Rose Connelly
