INTRO:  A


A
New Jersey Turnpike riding on a wet night
D                                         A
'neath the refinery's glow, out where the great black rivers flow
                                              D
License, registration, I ain't got none but I got a clear conscience
 A
About the things that I done
Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
D                     A                    D  A
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me

Maybe you got a kid, maybe you got a pretty wife
    D                            A
The only thing that I got's been bothering me my whole life
Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
D                         A                        D  A
Please don't you stop me, please don't you stop me

In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy,
      D                  A
Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby
Radio's jammed up with talk show stations
          D                                A
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk, till you lose your patience
                      D                 A
Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
         D  A
Oh, Oooh oh

Aint somebody out there, listen to my last prayer
D                A
Hiho silver-o, deliver me from nowhere
    D
Oh, Ooh

quite a semitone.
