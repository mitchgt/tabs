Capo 3

On the CD, Matthew plays the intro, middle instrumental part and outtro with the 4 chords
(ie, the [C], [G], [Am] and [F]) in an alternating way, dropping his little finger down on the "G"
note of the 6th string. That is, he plays the [C] alternating with [CaddG], which is X32003; then
the [G] alternated with [G6] which is 320000; then [Am] alternates with [Am7] which is 002213;
then [F] (which is played in these three places as an [Fmaj7]=X03210) alternating with
[FaddG] which is X03213....if you listen to the CD this may make a little sense.

[C] [G] [Am] [F] X 2

Well I [C]smoked my throat out last night
Hoping you'd [G]call or just stop by
Now I'm [Am]wheezing like the Oakland sky
Feeling like the [F]rusted tracks
And for[C]gotten dreams of the old train [G]lines

It's a [F]perpetual stone in my shoe
One that I'll [C]always be [G]trying to shake [Am]loose
An [F]ache in my chest and a [C]thorn in my [Am]side
More than a [F]scratch beneath my skin
Somewhere be[C]tween the be[G]ginning and the [Am]end
I don't [F]feel a lot lately [C]
I don't [F]feel whole lately [C]
I don't [F]feel much lately [C]
But that's how I [Am]hide
That's how I [G]hide

[C] [G] [Am] [F]

You wrote it [C]down not to draw attention to yourself
You lit the [G]pilot just to blow it out
Here the [Am]conversation's always too loud
And we're as [F]pathetic as the [C]jumper
Who listens to the [G]crowd

To say I [F]miss you wouldn't be enough
I feel like [C]Tom Waits [G]singing "Diamonds and [Am]Rust"
And I'm as [F]pathetic as a [C]junkie who know what he [G]does

It's a [F]perpetual stone in my shoe
One that I'll [C]always be [G]trying to shake [Am]loose
An [F]ache in my chest and a [C]thorn in my [Am]pride
More than a [F]scratch beneath my skin
Somewhere be[C]tween the be[G]ginning and the [Am]end
I don't [F]feel a lot lately [C]
I don't [F]feel whole lately [C]
I don't [F]feel much lately [C]
Now that's how I [Am]hide
That's how I [G]hide

[C] [G] [Am] [F] X 2
