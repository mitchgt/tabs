Int/Verse(What are you changin'?...)
G     C     Am     G


Pre-Chorus(But you can wake up younger under the knife...)
Am    Em    G      G


Chorus(There but for the grace of god...)
Am    Em    C      G

What are you changing? 
Who do you think you're changing? 
You can't change things, we're all stuck in our ways 
It's like trying to clean the ocean 
What do you think you can drain it? 
Well it was poison and dry long before you came

But you can wake up younger under the knife 
And you can wake up sounder if you get analyzed 
And I better wake up 
There but for the grace of God, go I

It's hard to believe your prophets 
When they're asking you to change things 
But with their suspect lives we look the other way 
Are you really that pure, Sir? 
Thought I saw you in Vegas 
It was not pretty, but she was

But she will wake up wealthy 
And you will wake up 45 
And she will wake up with babies 
There but for the grace of God, go I

What am I fighting for? 
The cops are at the front door 
I can't escape that way, the windows are in flames 
And what's that on your ankle? 
You say they're not coming for you 
But house arrest is really just the same

Like when you wake up behind the bar 
Trying to remember where you are 
Having crushed all the pretty things 
There but for the grace of God, go I

But I still believe 
And I will rise up with fists 
And I will take what's mine mine mine 
There but for the grace of God, go I 
There but for the grace of God, go I 
There but for the grace of God, go I 
There but for the grace of God, go I
