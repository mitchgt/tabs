          G   Bm7            C Em
Baby, hold it, just let me try 
                G                   Bm7
For just one minute be this other guy 
               C
and live his life 
                 G             Am7
With my home and faithful wife 
         C              D               C
And your pretty face to kiss some nights 


          G         C                 D     C
Ain't I a lucky guy, I get what I want yeah
          G         C  G             D
Ain't I a lucky guy, unlucky for some

Baby, I like it, it feels alright 
                G                   Bm7
Now that I see it through his cheating eyes 
               C
I can't stop smiling 
                 G             Am7
How could I not be satisfied?
         C              D               C
So glad I ain't the one on the losing side 


          G         C                 D     C
Ain't I a lucky guy, I get what I want yeah
          G         C  G             D Em
Ain't I a lucky guy, unlucky for some


   C            G           Em
No need to feel guilty baby 
    C           D C
I'm happy to be 
       Bm            Em                    A

Love will lead me but that's alright 'cause

Ain't I a lucky guy, unlucky for some
