If you like this then you might like my website, its at www.altcountrytab.com
and is called "The Alt-Country Tab Page".

Notes : I think that they have slightly mistuned guitars
on this one. The D is somewhere between a D and D#.
It could be the track is speeded up slightly or .. well..
many things could explain it. Playing it like this is fine though,
and perhaps with a capo on 1st if you feel so inclined. 

[D]I'm the boy that looks excited
[G]I'm the boy thats gonna fall apart
[E]Candyfloss, a plot device and
[A]I'm the boy that eats his heart out

[D]I know I should be more careful
[G]I know I should watch where I've been
[E]Candyfloss and she's a safe cracker
[A]She kissed me first then broke in
