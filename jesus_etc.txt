Transcription by Dan Van Skiver <spacedog@goeaston.net>

This one is destined to become a favorite. It's about the furthest from 
the sound of A.M. as you can get, but it's a great song. This one is 
played with bar chords and once you get the hang of the rhythm it's a 
really fun song to play. As with all my tabs, don't take these lyrics as 
final. They're the best I could come up with.


Intro: Dm C (play 4 times)

Dm             C
Jesus, don't cry

Dm           Bb
You can rely on me honey

F                    G                      C
You can come by anything you want

Dm      C
I'll be around

Dm          Bb
You were right about the stars

F       G                   C      Bb
Each one is a setting sun

F           C    Dm         C       Bb
Tall buildings shake, voices escape

                   G    F                    C
Singing sad, sad songs tuned to chords

F                               C    Dm             C
Strung down your cheeks, bitter melodies

Bb                    G     F      C
Turning your orbit around

Don't cry
You can rely on me honey
You can come by anytime you want
I'll be around
You were right about the stars
Each one is a setting sun

Tall buildings shake, voices escape
Singing sad, sad songs tuned to chords
Strung down your cheeks, bitter melodies
Turning your orbit around

Dm      C
Voices whine

Dm                    Bb
Skyscrapers are scraping together

        F           C
Your vocie is smoking

F           C             Dm          C
Last cigarettes are all you can get

Bb                C      F          C
Turning your orbit around

Dm   C
Our   love

Dm    Bb
Our    love

F       G                 C
Our   love is all we have

Our love
Our love is all (we've got so honey)?
Every one is a burning sun

Tall buildings shake, voices escape
Singing sad, sad songs tuned to chords
Strung down your cheeks, bitter melodies
Turning your orbit around

Voices whine
Skyscrapers are scraping together
Your voice is smoking
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around
Last cigarettes are all you can get
Turning your orbit around

(end)

Note: I'm not sure about one of the chords in the chorus. 
I know it's C-sharpish, but I'm not sure the exact name. 
I've just been playing a regular C# -- perhaps someone with a 
better ear than I can figure this out.
