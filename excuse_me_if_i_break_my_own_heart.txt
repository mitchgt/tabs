INTRO:          [G   G   Em7   Em7   G   G   Em7   Em7]

VERSE ONE:      Well, ex[G]cuse me if I break my own [Em7]heart
                It's [G]mine from the finish I guess
                [G] It's mine from the [Em7]start
                Situ[C]ation just don't seem so goddamned [G]smart
                Situ[C]ation is tearing me a[D]part

interrupted CHORUS:
                So you'll have to ex[G]cuse me if I break my own [Em7]heart
                [G   G   Em7   Em7]

VERSE TWO:      Well, excuse me if I break my own heart tonight
                Some things are born too strong
                Have to learn how to fight
                Situation keeps me drinking every goddamned day and night
                Situation don't seem so right

CHORUS:         So ex[G]cuse me if I break my own heart to[Em7]night
                Well, ex[G]cuse me if I break my own heart to[Em7]night
                After all it's [C]mine, after all it's [G]mine
                After all it's [C]mine
                Can I [D]have it back sometime?

VERSE THREE:    So if the rain falls down on your Mississippi talent
                Your eyes drift easy in the mighty
                If the rain falls down on your Mississippi talent
                Your eye's drifting right(?)
                You run the road, but your diary entry reads blank
                Is this some sort of joke to you?
                Is this some sort of joke to you?
                
repeat CHORUS [resolve to G]
