it might as well be you


F          Eb        Dm
There is nobody here tonight
Am          Eb           Dm       
Who doesn`t dance to the same tune as I
Gm      Gm(with a maj7)  Gm7     C7
Looking for that special someone new
        Am7     Bb               C
and hey babe it might as well be you

F        Eb             Dm
And as I fumble thru my change
Am                 Eb           Dm
The dance floor illuminates and there you are again
Gm          Gm(maj7)       Gm7    C7
I`m looking for someone to hold onto
    Am7     Bb       C       F
And babe it might as well be you

                    Bb                    F
It might as well be you that I wake up to tomorrow
                     Bb                         F
"  "      "  "    "  "    " tonight whispers my name
                      Bb            F
"  "      "  "    "   "   "  that I cling to
       Bb             F
that I laugh with and sing to
       Am7              Bb    C   F
That I kiss goodbye and never see again.

And through the fog that love creates
The night is filled with all the usual mistakes
They say u`r looking lonely baby and the`ve been looking too
and babe they might well be for you

And by the light of cigarettes
We introduce ourselves a way you don`t forget
I`m looking for something and anything will do  (???)
and hey babe it might as well be you

Ch
              Dm
And I f we go home tonight
            Am           Dm
You might find the very thing
      Bb      Dm
That come the morning light
           Am                F
Might well washed your mind of him
           Gm
So take me in tonight
        Bb            F
so we 2 losers might start to win...


(last ch)           Bb         F
It might as well be you that reminds me
       Bb               F
It was once her here beside me
       Am7                Bb    C   F
That I kissed good bye to never see again.
