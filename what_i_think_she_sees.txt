Intro
D G D G

D                                    G
I've been in this place many times before
        D                                            G
with my baby's things among my shoes and strings and clothes
    A                Bm                Bm6                 G7
but just because I'm here don't mean I can't run out that door
D          A          G                 D
Ain't that what those running shoes are for?


D                                   G
Baby likes to sleep on floor boards bare
D                                      G
Just to keep the peace well I join her there
A                Bm           Bm6           G7
She might say to me "A better man I can't recall"
D      A         G                D
what I think she sees ain't me at all


              Em           F#m                                  Bm
It ain't me at all to need somebody like some love struck casualty
               G            Bm                 D         A
It ain't me at all to be so ready to be what I think she sees


D                                G
Baby claims I kiss like I really care
D                                                G
Well I guess I'd say I don't but the truth ain't fair.
    A                  Bm            Bm6                    G7
Sometimes she looks at me and say's "Babe my heart just stalled"
D             A         G
But what I think she sees
D         A        G
what I think she sees
D         A         G               D
what I think she sees ain't me at all
