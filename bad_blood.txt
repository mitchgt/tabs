Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me?  I was weak, baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
          It's so sad to me.  Think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, You know we used to have mad love
So take a look what you've done, 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems, I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut, and, baby, now we got bad blood

Did you think we'd be fine? Got scars on my back from your knife
Don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they always last.
Did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
Time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't
          It's so sad to me.  Think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, You know we used to have mad love
So take a look what you've done, 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems, I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut, and, baby, now we got bad blood

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, You know we used to have mad love
So take a look what you've done, 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems, I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut, and, baby, now we got bad blood
