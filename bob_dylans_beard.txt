This tab was on this server at one time, and I have been unable to find a correct one since. This is a great song that was originally performed by Tweedy at his solo concerts and appeared on the "More Like the Moon" EP. If you haven't heard it, I highly suggest it. As far as I've got:


capo on 5th

G
You'll be happier when I'm gone
C
I'm much too busy to worry
G
I'll be sad and you'll feel bad
C
But I know you won't be sorry

G
And as I turn to go
C
Please don't wave goodbye
G
I refuse to cry

On roads that are paved
C D
With men who behave 
C D
Like they know where they're goin'

G
And I'll stop along the way
C
And it's then I'll think of you
G
And I'll wonder if you knew
C D
When I got blue
C D
And things got weird
C D
And I started growing
C D
Bob Dylan's beard
