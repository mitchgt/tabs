*The solo is composed of picking up and down the C pentatonic scale. just listen to the song and play around with the C pentatonic scale and it is pretty easy to figure out.

NOTE: this is just my attempt at the song if anyone has any suggestions or is better at tabbing songs, please, please feel free to correct my mistakes. Also any comments about the G7 chord. I'm not convinced that is what is being played in JCs version, but i think it sounds good when i play along.
