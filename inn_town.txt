Whiskeytown -- Inn Town 

D
Parking lot movie screen
        G
I can't feel anything
D                               G
Cigarettes  beat up TV  I can't feel anything
         D         G   Gsus  G
Now that I I'm Inn Town
       D               G   Gsus  G
I feel fine   fine for now
A                                         G  Gsus  G
Hang around with the people that I use to be
A                                  G
Hang around on a corner waiting to go  have a seat
         D         G  Gsus  G
Now that I I'm Inn Town
       D                G  Gsus  G
I feel fine    fine for now
D                                  G
50 Cents or a dollar three I don't owe you a thing
D
Spend a life on a heart that would
           G
Rather not feel anything
      Em        F#m       G           A
I can try I can see I can want it to be
      Em          F#m        G                    A
I can laugh I can feel I can say anything without feeling
         D         G  Gsus G
Now that I I'm Inn Town
D         G  Gsus  G
I I'm Inn Town

SOLO

A                                     G Gsus  G 
Hang around with the people we use to be
A                                                Bm
We hang around on a corner waiting to go  have a seat
      Em        F#m       G           A
I can try I can see I can want it to be
      Em          F#m        G                       A
I can laugh I can feel I can say anything that seems real
            Em          F#m          G
It's like a dream I can feel   I can laugh
   A                  Em          F#m     G              A
I still want it to be real   it'a dream I have  it's the last
       A   
Now it seems
         D         G  Gsus G
Now that I I'm Inn Town
       D               G   Gsus  G
I feel fine   fine for now
