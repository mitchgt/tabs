It Never Rains in Southern California

Am D G Em
Am D G

Got on [Am] board a westbound [D] 747 [G]
Didn't [Am] think before [D] deciding what to [G] do
All that [Am] talk of opportunity [D]
[G] TV breaks and [Em] movies
Rang [Am] true [D]
Sure rang [G] true

Seems it [Am] never rains in [D] Southern [G] California [Em]
Seems I've [Am] often heard that [D] kind of talk [G] before
It never [Am] rains in [D] California
But [G] girl don't they [Em] warn you
But it [Am] pours [D]
Man it [G] pours

I'm out of [Am] work I'm outta my [D] head
I'm out of self [G] respect I'm outta [Em] bread
I'm under [Am] loved and under [D] fed
I wanna go [G] home

It never [Am] rains in [D] California
But [G] girl don't they [Em] warn you
It [Am] pours [D]
Man it [G] pours

Am D G Em Am D G x2

Will you [Am] tell the folks back home I nearly made it?
Got offers but don't know which one to take
Please don't tell em how you found me
Don't tell em how you found me
Give me a break
Give me a break

Seems it never rains in Southern California
Seems I've often heard that kind of talk before
It never rains in California
But girl don't they warn you
It pours
Man it pours

Am D G Em Am D G x2
