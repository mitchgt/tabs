Kamera

This is a simple pop song that's been growing on me in the past few months. The
chords are pretty easy. I've tried my best on the lyrics but like all my
transcriptions, feel free to correct them, especially the line I have listed as
"which shackles belong". I've driven myself crazy trying to figure that one out.

intro: D
D
I need a camera to my eye
G              A
To my eye reminding
G                          Bm
Which lies that I've been hiding (which lies have I been hiding)?
A                         D          G
which echos belong
A                       G                           D        G
I've counted out the days to see how far
A                 G    D     G
I've driven in the dark
A                    G   D      G
With echoes in my heart
A                     C               G              A
For my family - tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
G                            D
You know it's not OK

(same as above)

I smashed your camera
I wanna know why
Tonight I'm deciding
Which lies that I've been hiding  (which lies have I been hiding)?
which echos belong
I'm counting out
A heart I know by heart
To walk me through this war
Where memories distort
For my family - tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk
You know it's not OK

D   G   A   G   Bm   A   D   G   A

I've counting out
But no one knows how far
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
I've driven in the dark
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
It echoes in my heart
(Tell 'em I'm lost)
For my family -
Tell 'em I'm lost, yeah I'm lost
No, it's not OK (now it's not OK)?
No it's not OK
No it's not OK
