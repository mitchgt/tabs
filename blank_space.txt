Blank Space | Capo 3

[G] Nice to meet you
Where you been?
I could show you incredible [Em] things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought [C/G] oh my god
Look at that face, you look like my next mistake
[D/A] Love's a game, want to play?

[G] New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine [Em]
Isn't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about [C/G] me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
[D/A] Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[G] So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
[Em] You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
[C] Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[D] Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

[G] So goddamn reckless
We'll take this way too [G/F#] far
[Em] It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
[C] Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[D] But I got a blank space baby
And I'll write your [G] name

[G] Cherry lips
Crystal skies
I could show you [G/F#] incredible [Em] things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
I’m your king, and you’re my [C/G] queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
[D/A] Wait, the worst is yet to come

[G] Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables [Em] turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like [C/G] oh my god
Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy
But [D/A] you'll come back each time you leave

[G] So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
[Em7] You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
[C] Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[D] Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

[G] So goddamn reckless
We'll take this way too [G/F#] far
[Em7] It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
[C] Got a long list of ex lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[D] But I got a blank space baby
And I'll write your [G] name

I'll [G/F#] write your [Em] name
I'll write your [G] name
I'll [G/F#] write your [Em] name
