i won't take the blame 
(Currie) 
The first version here I transcribed a while back, further down the page is the 
transcription recently (April 1999) submitted by Dave Bieler.

Capo 4th fret
NB. transcribed from the acoustic version, might differ slightly from the album version.

Em Em(F#) G (repeat)

G                    C                 G    C-G
Daylight comes with such surprising speed
G                    C                Am              D
Yesterday   You   talked of love  and now you want to leave
G                    C                  G   C-G
Dont expect  me to  stand in your way
G                    C                 Am              D
I am  powerless  to alter     any   action you might take


G                      C
But I won't take the Blame
G                                  C             Am
I was not thet one who played the joker in this game
G                                  C             D
I  am   not  the   one  who feels  nothing     anymore
             Am                    C            (Am  no chord)
So if you  walk out that          door I won't take the blame


Short instrumental
Em Em(F#) G (repeat)


G                        C                  G    C-G
As  I looked  at the   girl     I   once  adored
G                        C                 Am                  D
You  tell me  that I   hold you back  You tell me that you're bored
G                           C                G  C-G
So Like a pair of clowns we stand around an fight
G                        C                Am                D
But why don't you get it over with and   walk  out  of  my  life

G                      C
But I won't take the Blame
G                                  C             Am
I was not thet one who played the joker in this game
G                                  C             D
I  am   not  the   one  who feels  nothing     anymore
             Am                    C            (Am  no chord)
So if you  walk out that          door I won't take the blame


        Am                    D
And the steps of this stone church
G                              C
 are peppered with confetti hearts
        Am                     D
like    a  million  little     love   affairs
        Am                  D          G
     waiting     to       fall        apart

But I won't take the Blame
G                                  C             Am
I was not thet one who played the joker in this game
G                                  C             D

Note: All of the sus2 chords are my interpretation for effect. To be
closer to the original, use full major chords. I use the sus2 versions
when I finger-pick the chords, full majors when strumming with a pick.

And as I look at the girl I once adored 
You tell me that I hold you back you tell me that you're bored 
So like a pair of clowns we stand around and fight 
Why can't you get it over with and walk out of my life?
