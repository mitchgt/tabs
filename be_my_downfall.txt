1                2                           1
The bus is pulling out and I guess I'd better go
    4                                 2          3
Before I make a grave mistake and let my feelings show
        1                 2                          1
And twenty miles away she waits alone for me
       4                           2                   3
But when I try to picture her you're the one I see
         5        1                    6     2
And in another situation I could put up a fight
       7         3            1
But you will be my downfall tonight
1                       2                             1
So the night is coming down drowning us in blue
       4                                     2                  3
And it all points towards the things we know we shouldn't do
        1               2                           1
And I as I look at you and I fall under your spell
           4                                   2                  3
Well I know I should be thinking of her lying there herself
           5            1                             6         2
And when faced with temptation you know a man should stand and fight
       7         3            1
But you will be my downfall tonight
            8             6                       4
Be my downfall be my great regret be the one girl 
        3
That I'll never forget
4                      3               1
Be my undoing be my slow road to ruin tonight

I have highlighted the Fretted notes to help you see which notes you need to fret.The rhythms probably out but you should get the general idea.Pay attention to the hammer on and pull off parts as they give it that distinctive sound.

(Chords As Verse 1 )
So the night is coming down, drowning us in blue 
And it all points towards the things we know we shouldn't do 
And as I look at you and I fall under your spell 
Well I know I should be thinking of her lying there herself 
And when faced with temptation you know a man should stand and fight 
But you will be my downfall tonight
