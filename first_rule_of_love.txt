the first rule of love 
(Currie) 
Capo 5th fret

intro 
Am 

C          G                 Am
You'll get hooked, you'll get drugged
C              G                      Am
She'll be your essence, she'll be your blood
C               G                        F
You'll want her more and more but you'll never get enough
    Am         Em            Am
And that's the first rule of love

(verse chords)
She'll smell so sweetly in the morning
She'll make you feel so good inside
And you'll want her so much you'll give everything else up
And that's the first rule of love

(Instrumental) Am  G  F  Am   Am G F Am
               Em  G Am   Em  G Am

(verse chords)
You'll grow comfortable together
You'll start to fit like hand in glove
And then you'll start to hate the men that she used to dream of
And that's the first rule of love

F                Am   F              Am
You'll miss her madly,  when you're apart
Em            G              F             
Love is like gravity holding down your heart


You'll grow envious and bitter
She'll be enquiring and concerned
And you'll feel so close to her but never close enough
To get past the first rule of love

                C                G                     F
And with the awkwardness of strangers You will finally give up
        Am              Em           Am
No exceptions to the first rule of love
        Am              Em           Am
No exceptions to the first rule of love
