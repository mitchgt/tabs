(other verses the same)

She met a boy up in Kentucky
Charlie was his name
Just when he thought he got lucky
She stole his watch and chain
She always kept on movin' and she never wasted time
And they said she left quite a string of broken hearts behind
Woke up alone and now she's gone

Verse chords with harmonica

Me, I wasn't even trying
You could say I was content
She went through my life like lightning
Blew out the other end
I still taste her kisses, smell her perfume in the wind
And if I could you know that I would do it all again
She done me wrong, and now she's gone

Note: I'm not too sure about the C C/B G run but it's close enough for my purposes.
Feel free to change. gw
