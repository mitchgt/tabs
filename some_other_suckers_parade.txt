 G          A                   D                  (verse riff)
I must've had a million damn unlucky days 
                G                         A                        D
But there ain't no cloud that a bottle can't chase away 
 G               A                                 D             (verse riff)
I've done my deal of living, ran from place to place 
                 G                      A                         D
But when the roof comes in I don't wanna take it straight 

                  Bmin   F#min
They say with faith any soul can make it 
    A                           E       
But hell, why should I wait 
            G                      A                          D         
'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade 

I've had my share of heartaches, let downs and tricks 
But the everyday blues is the one thing I can fix 
I've heard those holy brethren muttering my name 
But it ain't no sin to drink when you're suffering 

Patience, they say, is a saintly virtue 
But hell, why should I wait 
'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade 

F#min                             Bmin
When every heavy sky just empties on your fate 
E                               A
Sometimes keeping dry's something to celebrate 

        
So if the road of sin is the one I'm taking 
I ain't gonna stray 
'Til the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade
