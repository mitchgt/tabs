Way over yonder in the minor key

G C G

I [G] lived in a place called Okfuskee [C]
And I had a little girl in a holler [G] tree
I said, little girl, it's plain to [C] see,
There ain't nobody that can sing like [G] me
[D] Ain't nobody that can sing like [Em] me

She said it's hard for me to see
How one little boy got so ugly
Yes, my little girly, that might be
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

[C] Way over yonder in the minor [G] key
[Em] Way over yonder in the [D] minor [G] key
There [D] ain't nobody that can sing like [Em] me

We walked down by the Buckeye Creek
To see the frog eat the goggle eye bee
To hear that west wind whistle to the east
There ain't nobody that can sing like me

Oh my little girly will you let me see
Way over yonder where the wind blows free
Nobody can see in our holler tree
And there ain't nobody that can sing like me

[C] Way over yonder in the minor [G] key
[Em] Way over yonder in the [D] minor [G] key
There [D] ain't nobody that can sing like [Em] me

Her mama cut a switch from a cherry tree
And laid it on the she and me
It stung lots worse than a hive of bees
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me

Now I have walked a long long ways
And I still look back to my tanglewood days
I've led lots of girls since then to stray
Saying, "ain't nobody that can sing like me"
Ain't nobody that can sing like me

[C] Way over yonder in the minor [G] key
[Em] Way over yonder in the [D] minor [G] key
There [D] ain't nobody that can sing like [Em] me

[C] Way over yonder in the minor [G] key
[Em] Way over yonder in the [D] minor [G] key
There [D] ain't nobody that can sing like [Em] me
There [D] ain't nobody that can sing like [Em] me
