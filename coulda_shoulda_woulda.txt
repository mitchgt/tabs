  Intro:        A

[ A ]  coulda shoulda  woulda  but I never did 
 take it  all back   [ E ]  keep it all hid 
coulda  shoulda  woulda I wish that I had
[ G ] my life was good  but It's [ A ] all gone  bad  

[ A ] coulda shoulda woulda  stayed in school
 james brown was right  [ E ] I  was a  fool  
 I  wish  I  woulda  got a  G.E.D.  now
[ G ] you  want  fries with  [ A ]  that  B.L.T

  
Chorus:

[ D ] coulda shoulda woulda  zigged when I  zagged 
[ A ] diamond to dust  riches to rags   
[ E ]  20-20 hindsight [ G ] what/such   a  drag    
[ A ] coulda shoulda woulda… come  on     

instrumental    A     E       G   A     

I  got  13 children  and  3 ex-wives with eyes
Like  daggers and  tongues  like knives 
All the  big  mistakes  I've  made  twice  I'll
Make  em again before they put me on ice   

When  my  life  is  over and I  order  my  wings
If  ST.  Peter  asks me how I feel about  things 
Don't  keep  me waiting all alone at the gate
He  say coulda shoulda woulda's just a little to late
