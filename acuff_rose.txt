A                     E                    A
Early in the morning, sometimes late at night

D/F#                              E               A
sometimes I get the feelin', that everything's allright

                      E                    A
early in the evening, sometimes in the day

D/F#                              E             A
sometimes I get the feeling, that everything's okay

       D/A        E/A D/A E/A    D/A  E/A             D/A  E/A
'cause everything,               cuts against the tide

D/A  E/A    D/A   E/A  A            E  A  A A A E A A A A D/F# E A
when you're by    my   si-i-i-i-de

A                    E             A
Name me a song, that everybody knows

  D/F#                 E     A
I betcha it belongs to Acuff-Rose

                                E     A
Children in the playground, the folks in the home

D/F#              E         A
Anybody anywhere, has never been alone

       D/A        E/A D/A E/A    D/A  E/A             D/A  E/A
'cause everything,               cuts against the tide

D/A  E/A    D/A   E/A  A            E  A  A A A E A A A A D/F# E A
when I    hear  that si-i-i-i-gh.


The strumming is pretty fast.  Just treat the E to A as the E just tying
the string of A chords together.  Any corrections are encouraged and
gratefully welcome.
