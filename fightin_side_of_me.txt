I hear people talkin bad about the way 

                             A
they have to live here in this country

B7
Harpin on the wars we fight

                                     E
And grippin bout the way things oughta be


I don't mind them switchin sides 

                                 A
And standin up for things they believe in

           B7
But when there runnin down our country man 

                                    E
There walkin on the fightin side of me



E                             B7
They're alkin on the fightin side of me


Runnin down the way of life our 

                                    E
Fightin men have fought and died to keep


If you don't love it leave it

                              A
Let this song that I'm singin be a warnin

        B7
When your runnin down my country hoss 

                                   E
You're walkin on the fightin side of me



E
I read about some squirrly guy who claims 

                         A
That he just don't believe in fightin

      B7
And I wonder just how long 

                                  E
The rest of us can count on being free


They love our milk and honey 

                                        A
But they preach about some other way of livin

           B7
When there runnin down our country man they're

                              E
Walkin on the fightin side of me



E                             B7
They're walkin on the fightin side of me


Runnin down the way of life our 

                                    E
Fightin men have fought and died to keep


If you don't love it leave it

                              A
Let this song that I'm singin be a warnin

        B7
When your runnin down our country man 

                                   E
You're walkin on the fightin side of me



F                             C7
Walkin on the fightin side of me


Runnin down the way of life our 

                                    F
Fightin men have fought and died to keep


If you don't love it leave it

                              B
Let this song that I'm singin be a warnin

        C7
When your runnin down our country hoss 

                                   F
You're walkin on the fightin side of me
