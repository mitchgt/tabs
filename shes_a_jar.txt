She begs me not to miss her


[verse chords twice]


She says forever
To light a fuse 
We could use 
A hand full of wheel 
And a day off
And a bruised road
However you might feel
Tonight is real

[verse chords twice]

When I forget how to talk I sing
Won't you please
Bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck
Like a question unposed

[strings solo verse chords twice]


chorus:
G           am
Just climb aboard

    D                         em
The tracks of a train's arm

                     Bm      Bbm  am
In my fragile family tree

                           D
And watch me float inches above


The people under me

[harmonica solo verse chords twice]

Please beware the quiet front uyard
I warned you 
Before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes you poor devil

[verse chords twice]

Are there really ones like these
The ones I dream
Float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you

[verse chords twice]

I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday is not enough
Oh I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday is not enough

[verse chords twice]

chorus

[harmonica solo verse chords 4 times]

She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war 
My feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit her

Notes: Essentially another simple song musically, but the phrasing
is trickier. The verses are G Bm C but be careful as Jeff Tweedy
plays around with the timimg of his phrasing from verse to verse.
Another thing to note is how he has used the same Bm Bbm Am progression
in the chorus as he did on "Far Far Away".

I received an email from Rob van Alstyne [rob@nycap.rr.com] who suggested

...I think after the C is strummed jeff hammers on with the middle
finger on the D string second fret once quickly and then possibly hits
the B-string 3rd fret once, releases and hits the B-string at the first
fret once and then hammers on at the B-string first fret, and then hits
the B-string once more letting it ring.

Expressing that is quite tough but I guess its sort of

With help along the way from Rob van Alstyne [ rob@nycap.rr.com ],
Eric McMullen [ waynemcmullen@hotmail.com ] and Porter Yax [ porter@linknet.net ]
With some tablature from a version by Howie Wang ( howie_wang@hotmail.com )
which is at www.gumbopages.com/wilco.html If you like this then you might like my website, its at www.altcountrytab.com 
Notes: Essentially another simple song musically, but the phrasing

Another thing to note is how he has used the same Bm Bbm Am progression
in the chorus as he did on "Far Far Away". 
Porter Yax noted I had a F#m? in the chorus, and identified it as a ebdim
which can be played as xx1212 or x6787x ( low to high strings ), and he made 
a change to the end chords. 
I received an email from Rob van Alstyne [ rob@nycap.rr.com ] who suggested 

...I think after the C is strummed jeff hammers on with the middle 
finger on the D string second fret once quickly and then possibly hits 
the B-string 3rd fret once, releases and hits the B-string at the first 
fret once and then hammers on at the B-string first fret, and then hits 
the B-string once more letting it ring. 

Also an email from Eric McMullen saying 
i noticed on your tab from wilco, shes a jar, twitty does one thing you didnt    mention.Ê 
when he is singing the verses he plays just G, Bm, C, but during the pauses he    plays 
the classical G for the same amount of time, but instead of going straight to    Bm he 
slides all his fingers from G one fret back before going to Bm for just one    strum and 
then going back to C.Ê
