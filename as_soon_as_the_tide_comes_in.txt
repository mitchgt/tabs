as soon as the tide comes in 
(Currie) 
Intro
D  A/C#  G   A  D  A/C#  G  A D


D      D/C#              G          D 
 You'd better get some sleep for a change 
         D/C#     G                A   D
Before tomorrow brings you down 
    D/C#                          G               D               
By three o'clock they'll both be sitting on that plane 
             Bm7       A
Hopelessly honeymoon bound 
       D           D/C#      G         D
And I hope no one asks you to kiss this bride 
            D/C#        G
Or tie tin cans to the car 
 A      D           D/C#       G         D
And if friends and relations mingle outside 
 F#7                   Bm
You can linger at the bar 

     G           D               G            D    D7
So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon 
                 G    Gm
Let the action begin 
              D                 G  
Cos it's as sure as sunrise and  sure as time 
A       D             A/C#        G             A
  The bride will be changing and you will be crying 
     D             A/C#      G              A   D   A
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes   in 


You'll feel like some soap opera star 
Predictably hitting the booze 
With your standard issue broken heart 
You step into your Saturday shoes 
And you might feel better if you slapped her face 
Or slipped some pills in his wine 
But instead some voice in your head keeps saying 
You'll look back and laugh sometime 

So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon 
Let the action begin 

Cos it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time 
The bride will be changing and you will be crying 
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in 

    A                                                      D
So put on your lipstick and check that you hat's straight too 
        A                                        Bm  A D
Cos if they can go through with it you can do it too 
    

So bring on the rainclouds and block out the moon 
Let the action begin 

Cos it's as sure as sunrise and as sure as time 
The bride will be changing and you will be crying 
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in 
And it will be raining as soon as the tide comes in
