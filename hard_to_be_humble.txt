INTRO:  I,  V7,  I, V7


CHORUS:
   I                                                              V7    
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble, ..  when you're perfect in every way
                                                                                
I can't wait to look in the mirror, .... 'cause I get better lookin' each day
   I                             I7                  4     
To know me is to love me ___,  I must be a hell of a man
                          I                  V7                    I     
Oh, Lord, it's hard to be humble, .. but I'm doing the best that I can

  I       IV      I                                                V7     
I used to have a girlfriend, .. but I guess she just couldn't com-pete
                                                                  I      
With all of these love-starved women, .. who keep clamoring at my feet
                                               I7                          IV     
Well I prob'ly could find me a-nother .. but I guess they're all in awe of me
                       I                     V7                     I   V7
Who cares, I never get lonesome, .. 'cause I treasure my own compan-y,  Oh
  I               IV         I                                     V7      
I guess you could say I'm a loner, .. a cowboy out-law, tough and proud
                                       
Oh, I could have lots of friends if I want-a /
                                                 I       
     / .. but then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
                             
Some folks say that I'm ego-tistical /
                  I7                        IV       
     / .. Hell, I don't even know what that means
                            I          
I guess it has somethin' to do with the way /
                 V7                          I      V7
     / .. that I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans, Oh
