Diana Sweets
by Ron Sexsmith

Capo I

[D] Down St. Paul there is a gaping hole
Where once [C] my Diana used to be

But [D] summer's faded into autumn
Gone with [C] all her golden opportunities

Was sipping on a soda once with my uncle George
He said he'd take me if I was a good boy

That was long ago the door forever closed
Still in my mind I see

Diana Sweets and the sweet sweet summers I've known
Sweet summers are long gone
And everything seems to be wrong
Diana

From western hill cut through my window sill
In some hotel in Krefield, Germany

Am I doomed to wander every back road of my mind for all eternity?

Why do I keep on knocking when there's nobody home?
And calling where no one can pick up the phone?

For sentimental reasons I keep on believing
In some faded dream of Diana Sweets
And the sweet, sweet summers I've known
Sweet summers now long gone
Diana, where have you gone?
Diana

Why do we keep on knocking when there's nobody home?
And calling where no one can pick up the phone?
For sentimental reasons I'll keep on believing
In some faded dream of Diana Sweets
And the sweet, sweet summers I've know
Sweet summers now long gone
When everything seems to be wrong
[A] Diana Diana Diana
