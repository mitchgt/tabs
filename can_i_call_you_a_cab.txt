Can I Call You A Cab (Petty)

drop D tuning

I've been [D] better [D4/B (release G for B)]
But I'm pretty sure that you've been better too
Can I [Bm ] take the [A (V)] piece of [G#] me that [F#] I don't [Em] like
And [G] kill it with the same in [D] you?

I've got your letters
And a box of crap mouldering in my house
I can't bring myself to deal with it
But I can't throw it out

Let's draw a line in the sand
You take the sea
I'll take the dry land
It's your turn to crash and burn
To find out what I never had to learn

I've been better 
The ghost of you still lingers in my head
It follows me back home when I've been out
And tries to get inside my bed

It steals my sweater
And spends all day hanging round my flat
Can't you see I want the mornings to myself
Can I call you a cab?

Let's draw a line in the sand
You take the sea
I'll take the dry land
It's your turn to crash and burn
To find out what I never had to learn

Your turn to learn
Someday you're going to crash and burn
Your turn to learn
Someday you're going to crash and burn

Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

I've been better
When I think of all the lies you spun for me
And how you made the most of knowing that
I wanted to believe

When you said forever
I'm pretty sure you meant it at the time
But looking back it's more than likely that
You were spinning me a line

We built a house on the sand
You take the sea
I'll swim for dry land
It's your turn to crash and burn
To find out what I never had to learn
Your turn to learn
Someday you're going to crash and burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
