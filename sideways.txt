SIDEWAYS
by Travis Meadows

If I could buy myself a conscience that wasn’t broken 
Mend every fence I drove my hard head through 
Re-lock all the doors I wish I never opened 
Unlearn the things I wish I never knew 
And it came out through the bottle
It came out through my fists
It came out way too early
I wish it never did

Push it down, it comes out sideways
Push it down, it comes out sideways
Bitter roads turn into highways
Push it down it comes out sideways

I have days where it’s just nose above water
Keep it together while I fall apart
I have moments when I act just like my father
The only man that ever broke my heart
And it comes out in my silence
Sometimes unwanted tears
Comes out disguised as anger but it’s really fear

Push it down, it comes out sideways
Push it down, it comes out sideways
Bitter roads turn into highways
Push it down, it comes out sideways

To really give it the sound he does, be sure to do a bridge scrape on the beats 2 and 4, or just emphasize those beats. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD6DsSTU800 (capo 2) or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgSOC7dZFZ4 (capo 4).

Can play in either open G or standard tuning with capo 2.
He also plays it in D standard with capo 4.
