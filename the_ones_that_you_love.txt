Go and tell your mother, go and tell your friends

You've been fooled again 
      G/D             D            G/D                   G
He appeared like magic and he left you on a late night train 
                         D
Yeh, some things never change 

Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 
Yeh baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 

If you could just be patient, pretty soon you would forget his name 
And face this world again 
If you could just stop looking for someone special 
You might save yourself some pain

Every little lie makes you look so dumb 
                          G                            D
They tell you nobody has ever come as close as you've come 
           G                    D                C
So baby tonight you've got the right to feel so numb 


              C             G             D   G/D
Cos baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere 
              C             G             D   G/D
Yeh baby the ones that you love lead you nowhere
