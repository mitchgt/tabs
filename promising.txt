Promising
Wilco

I found this tab on the Insurgent Country web page.
I think it's pretty accurate, so i thought I'd post it on this site for anyone interested (with a couple of notes that I've made).

Wilco-"Promising"
from the Chelsea Walls soundtrack
Original tab by Patrick Corbett
Additional input by triggercut

Just a couple of additions/clarifications to Patrick's original tab.
"Capo to F#" means capo 2nd fret. All chords are relative to the capo.
The A riff goes something like this (I think this is what he means by "E hammer on F3"):
e------------0-------------
B---------------2----------
G-----------------2--------
D-------2-----------2------
A----0---------------------
E-----------------------0h2

Here's the tab as I found it on the Insurgent Country web page:
