Blue Eyes

[D] [G]

Sometimes I get upset when [D] people treat me bad
I don't have time to [C] think and so I get real [G] mad
I pull my hair and find somewhere where [C] I can be alone
And [D] when I do I think of you and head myself back [G] home

Where I've got [C] chores to keep me [D] busy, a [G] clock to keep my time
A [C] pretty girl to [G] love me, with the same last name as [D] mine
And when the [C] flowers wilt, a big old quilt to [G] keep us warm
I've got the [D] sun to see your blue eyes and tonight you're in my [G] arms

Sometimes I get unwound when [D] fancy cars drive past
Money don't get me [C] down, but I can't make it [G] last
I bite my nails and if that fails I [C] go get myself stoned
And [D] when I do I think of you and head myself back [G] home

Where I've got [C] chores to keep me [D] busy, a [G] clock to keep my time
A [C] pretty girl to [G] love me, with the same last name as [D] mine
And when the [C] flowers wilt, a big old quilt to [G] keep us warm
I've got the [D] sun to see your blue eyes and tonight you're in my [G] arms

Sometimes I get unwound when [D] fancy cars drive past
Money don't get me [C] down, but I can't make it [G] last
And I bite my nails and if that fails I [C] go get myself stoned
And [D] when I do I think of you and head myself back [G] home

Where I've got [C] chores to keep me [D] busy, a [G] clock to keep my time
A [C] pretty girl to [G] love me, with the same last name as [D] mine
And when the [C] flowers wilt, a big old quilt to [G] keep us warm
