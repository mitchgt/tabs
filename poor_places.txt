capo 3 

G              D           Em               C          A7      C 
It's my fathers' voice dreaming off sailors sailin' off in the mornin' 
For the air-conditioned rooms at the top of the stairs 
His jaw's been broken his bandages wrapped too tight 
His fangs have been pulled and I really wanna see you tonight 

There's bourbon on the breath of the singer you love so much 
He takes all his words from the books you don't read anyway 
His jaw's been broken his bandages wrapped too tight 
His fangs have been pulled and I really wanna see you tonight 

Someone ties a bow in my backyard to show me love 
My voice is climbin' walls smoking I want love 
My jaw's been broken myheart is wrapped in ice 
My fangs have been pulled and I really wanna see you tonight 

G         D            Em   G7 
And it makes no difference to me 
C          Am7sus4*    G    A 
How they cried all over on the seas 
C          Cm         G 
When it's hot in the poor places tonight 
Eb     C     G 
I'm not goin' outside 

They cried all over on the seas 
And it makes no difference to me 
And it's hot in the poor places tonight Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
I'm not goin' outside Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 

And it's hot in the poor places tonight Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
I'm not goin' outside Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
I'm not goin' outside Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
I'm not goin' outside Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 

Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel Fox-trot 
Yan-kee Ho-tel 

Am7sus4 thing is just x00013 

Why not smile? 

No more songs of Tallahasse and Nashville. 
We got music right outside the windowsill

before "i'm not going outside" the walk up to F#(no capo notation), the equivalant of Eb with a capo, tab is without capo: 
a-----------8-9----- 
e--6-8-9----------- 

Every song's a comeback.  Every moment's a little bit later.

approximate solo, tab=with capo 

e----------------------------0--- 
b-0-1-------0--1---------------2-- 
g-0---2-0---0----2-----0----------0-- 
d-0----------0-------2-----------------2-- 
then arpeggio C chord into strummed G, etc. 

Every song's a comeback.  Every moment's a little bit later.

As posted separately by el todd but moved here for completeness... 

The voicings, to my ears, sound closer to the record if you capo at the first fret instead of the third. This is especially evident in the "And it makes no difference to me..." section of the song. Hope this helps.

capo 1 
(All chords and notes relative to capo) 

A E F#m D B7 D 
It's my fathers' voice trailing off sailors sailin' off in the mornin' 
For the air-conditioned rooms at the top of the stairs 
His jaw's been broken his bandages wrapped too tight 
His fangs have been pulled and I really wanna see you tonight 

There's bourbon on the breath of the singer you love so much 
He takes all his words from the books you don't read anyway 
His jaw's been broken his bandages wrapped too tight 
His fangs have been pulled and I really wanna see you tonight 

Someone ties a bow in my backyard to show me love 
My voice is climbin' walls smoking I want love 
My jaw's been broken myheart is wrapped in ice 
My fangs have been pulled and I really wanna see you tonight 

A E F#m A7 
And it makes no difference to me 
D B7 A B7 
How they cried all over overseas 
D Dm A (climb on single notes: A, B, C, E) 
When it's hot in the poor places tonight 
F D A 
I'm not goin' outside 

Fmaj7 Dsus2 A 
They cried all overseas 
And it makes no difference to me 
When it's hot in the poor places tonight 
I'm not goin' outside 
When it's hot in the poor places tonight 
I'm not goin' outside 
I'm not goin' outside 
I'm not goin' outside

Who would believe that once she was mine"
