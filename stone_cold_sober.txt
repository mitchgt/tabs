stone cold sober 
(Currie) 
Intro - F#m   Bm    A

                  F#m        Bm             A
Everybody in the funhouse ,Says they want out 
                      F#m   Bm                      A
But we're taking our time ,'Cos we're in love with time 
              F#m        Bm                   A
Whole generations thinking of themselves ,As infidels and pop stars 
           F#m               Bm                     A
While the bomb loses patience We line up and just lean against the bar 


A               E                                      D
Stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love
A               E                                      D
Stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love. 


Caught in the headlights ,Wide-eyed and ready to receive 
We are the dead life ,Locked in dogfights lost in disbelief 
And these dark days ,Make the nights seem brighter than they are 
So while Fleet Street rolls and the moon glows In the funhouse the fun starts 

Stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love
We're stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love , love

(verse chords)
We are the dead life, we are dead life, So C'mon C'mon

Break - D    A     A     D  x 4

Born in the half-light Of threats and bribes In a hopeless porn parade 
We get the dog's life, tidbits train us What to wear, what not to say 
When you're footloose but you just feel limbless Life gets in the way 
So we get loaded or totally legless But stay the same 

Stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love
We're stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love
We're stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love
We're stone cold sober, looking for bottles of love

Outro  D  A   A   D repeat til fade

We are the dead life.......................
