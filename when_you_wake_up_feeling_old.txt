When You Wake Up Feeling Old

[G] When you [C] wake up
[G] Feeling [C] old
[G] At this [C] piano [G] filled with [C] souls
[C] Some strange [Bm] purse
Stuffed [C] nervous with [Am] gold
[G] Can you [C] be where you want to [G] be?

[G] Walk down [C] any street
[G] You can [C] find
[G] Look at [C] any clock [G] telling [C] time
[C] Sing some strange [Em] verse
[C] From some strange song of [Am] vines
[G] And you'll [C] be where you want to [G] be

[Em] I know I [Am] can't sing
[G] Until she [Am] brings the song to [Em] life
[Am] And I blend with kings
[A7] I'd never change a [G] thing

[G] Who knows [C] anything
[G] I don't [C] know
[G] There are so [C] many things
[G] I must leave [C] alone
[C] Some strange [Bm] person is [C] calling you their [Am] home
[G] Can you [C] be where you want to [G] be?

Can you be
Where you want to be?
Can you be
Where you want to be?
Can you be
Where you want to be?
