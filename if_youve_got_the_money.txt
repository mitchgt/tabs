If [D] you Got The Money 
I've Got The time 
We'll go honky-tonkin' 
And we'll have a time [G] 
We'll [A7] make all the night spots 
Dance, drink beer and wine
If You Got The Money, Honey 
I've Got The Time. [D] 

[D] There ain't no use to tarry 
So let's start out toni-ight 
We'll spread joy, boy, oh boy 
And we'll spread it right [G] 
We'll [A7] have more fun, baby 
All the way down the line 
If You Got The Money, Honey 
I've Got The Time. [D] 

[D] If You Got The Money 
I've Got The time 
We'll go honky-tonkin' 
And we'll have a time [G] 
Bring [A7] along your Cadillac 
Leave my old wreck behind 
If You Got The Money, Honey 
I've Got The Time. [D] 

[D] Yes, we'll go honky-tonkin' 
Make ev'ry club in to-own 
We'll go to the park where it's dark 
We won't fool around [G] 
But [A7] if you run short of money 
I'll run short of time 
'Cause you with no more money, honey 
I've no more Time. [D]
