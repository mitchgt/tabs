Drinking from the Swimming Pool

Honey I'm [D] deep blue
Drinking from the [Em] swimming pool
Tired of [D] knowing you
Tired of [Em] wanting you

I've got a [A] gallon down [A7 | A]
I've got a [Em] fountain down my throat
Swimming the [A7] pool wide
[A] And you're the [Em] sun in my pool [A] side

Honey I'm [D] up a drain
Raking wet [Em] leaves away
Watching the [D] evening set
After a [Em] lousy day

And it's a [A7] crying shame
You're not around [Em] so you can't see
As far as a [A] man can sink down
Without your [Em] charming company [A]

Honey I'm [D] deep blue
Drinking from a [Em] swimming pool
Tired of [D] knowing you
Tired of [Em] wanting you

I've got a [A] gallon down
I've got a [Em] fountain down my throat
Swimming the [A7] pool wide
And you're the [Em7] sun in my pool [A] side

Honey I'm [D] much the same
After a [Em] couple years
Wearing out [D] shirts and shoes
Hitting up [Em] friends for beers

Came from the [A] deep end down
Having a [Em] party under glass
Here in the [A] land of the blind
A one eyed [Em] man should keep his mouth shut
