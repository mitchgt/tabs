                       C
If you find yourself standin'
                   F
At the end of the line
                           D
Looking for a piece of something
                  G
Maybe a piece of mind

                     C
Got all lost and run down
                F
Nowhere to hold on
                                  D
Tired of "Take your place at the end, son!"
                  G
Get to you one by one

               F
No light ever shines
                    C
Dead end tears that dry
                 G
Maybe a waste of words in time
F                 C
Never a waste of life

F                    G
Every hour will be spent
               F                  C C/B Am
Just fillin' a quota, getting along
Am
Handcuffs hurt worse
                          G
When you've done nothing wrong

No thanks to the treadmill
No thanks to the grindstone
There's plenty of dissent from
These rungs below

Clockwork of destruction
Hangin' low over our heads
Always a smokestack cloud
Or a slow walkin' death

No light ever shines
Dead end tears that dry
Maybe a waste of words in time
Never a waste of life
Maybe a waste of words in time
Never a waste of life
