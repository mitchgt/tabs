Christmas at the Airport

A

[A] Outside the taxi [D] window
on the way to catch my flight
I noticed snowflakes [Bm] playing
In the ever failing light

When he dropped me at departures
It was really coming down
Deep and crisp beneath
And it settled on the ground

It looks like Christmas
Christmas at the airport
All the planes are [Bm] grounded
And the fog is rolling in

It looks like [D] Christmas
Christmas at the airport this [F#] year
Doors are locked and bolted
Let the festivities begin! [A]

The terminal was [Bm] seething
Without much Christmas [A] cheer
So I found an empty [Bm] closet
And bedded down in [A] there [F#]

When I woke much later
I was quite alone
Checkin was deserted
Everyone had gone

It looks like Christmas
Christmas at the airport
I took a set of X-rays
They came out rather well

It looks like Christmas
Christmas at the airport this year
Now I'm doing Santa's sleigh ride
On the baggage carousel

It looks like [D] Christmas
Christmas at the airport
I should be at the table
With all my kith and kin

It looks like Christmas
Christmas at the airport this year
Don't save me any turkey
I found a burger in a bin
