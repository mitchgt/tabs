 GD  (same chords after each chorus and for solo section)

 G                                      C     G
 Quit school when she was seventeen
 G                                         D
 Senator on TV calls her welfare queen
 Em                            C     G
 Used to be daddy's little girl
 G                                          D            C
 Now she needs help in this mean ol' world

 Buys cassette tapes in the bargain bin
 Loves Carlene Carter and Loretta Lynn
 Tries to have fun on a Saturday night
 Sunday morning don't shine too bright

 It's welfare music
 Watch the baby dance
 To the welfare music
 Well she ever stand a chance?

 Takes two make three but one ain't here
 Still chasing women and drinking beer
 Says nobody understands how he feels
 But that don't pay the monthly bills

 Angry fat man on the radio
 Wants to keep his taxes way down low
 Says there oughta be a law
 Angriest man you ever saw

 Welfare music
 Just watch the baby dance
 To the welfare music
 Well she ever stand a chance?

 Solo

 Baby dance circles on the floor
 Round and round just like before
 Baby fall down
 Baby get up
 Baby needs a drink from a lovin' cup

 It's welfare music
 Watch the baby dance
 To the welfare music
 Well she ever stand a chance?

 Welfare music
 Just watch the baby dance
 To the welfare music
 Well she ever stand a chance?
