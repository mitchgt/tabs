        G
I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
      D
On a bed of California stars
             C
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
      G
On a bed of California stars
       G
I'd love to feel your hand touching mine
             D
And tell me why I must keep working on
          C
Yes, I'd give my life to lay my head tonight
      G
On a bed of California stars


G D C G    G D C G

              G
I'd like to dream my troubles all away
      D
On a bed of California stars
 C
Jump up from my starbed and make another day
     G
Underneath my California stars
         G
They hang like grapes on vines that shine
     D
And warm the lovers glass like friendly wine
         C
So, I'd give this world

just to dream a dream with you
      G
On a bed of California stars
