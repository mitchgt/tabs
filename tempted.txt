verse 1:

	            B              D#m/A#          G#m
	I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste, a flannel for my face
	C#/F                       Em
	Pajamas, a hairbrush, new shoes and a case
	   Bm                               F#m               G/A   A
	I said to my reflection, "let's get out of this place"
	  D         E                            G
	Passed the church and the steeple, the laundry on the hill
	 B
	Billboards and the buildings
	A/E            C#/F
	Memories of it still keep
	Bm/F#         E
	Calling and calling
	    Bm/F#         G/F           E    E/D
	But forget it all     I know I will

chorus:

	B               B/A       E/G#      E
	Tempted by the fruit of another
	B                B/A        E/G#     E
	Tempted but the truth is discovered
	             C#
	What's been going on
	         F#
	Now that you have gone
	             B     B/A
	There's no other
	E/G#             E         B     B/A
	Tempted by the fruit of another
	E/G#              E          C#m       Em
	Tempted but the truth is discovered

verse 2:

	I'm at the carpark, the airport, the baggage carousel
	The people keep on prying, ain't wishing I was well
	I said, "It's no occasion, it's no story I can tell"
	At my bedside, empty pocket, a foot without a sock
	Your body gets much closer
	I fumble for the clock
	Alarmed by the seduction
	I wish that it would stop

	[repeat chorus]

verse 3 [half-length]

	I bought a novel, some perfume, a fortune over you
	But it's not my conscience that hates to be untrue
	   Bm                              F#m                  G/A A D
	I asked of my reflection, "tell me what is there to do"

	[repeat chorus to fade]
