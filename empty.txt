Intro
Dm C G F
Dm C G A

Dm           C
Don't get so distressed 
         G              F
If the good life won't arrive 
        Dm            C
You've been reading S.O.S. 
           F                      G
When it's just your clock reading 5:05 

Dm C G A
             Dm            C
And why are you so possessed 
          G                  F
By the thought that she got free 
            Dm                     C
And why are you figuring who's the best 
                F 
When just your luck ran out 
     G
and she chose me 

   A      
We do not lie side by side 
     G
and mock the thought of you 
    A
And I don't take her hand and ask 
    G
Is this what he used to do? 
     A
'Cos I just want to free her from 
       G
Your jails of jealous dreams 
         Dm       C              G
'Cos at least a house when it's empty 
F       Dm
Stays clean 

repeat intro

I won't pretend 
That I was simply swayed 
It was a two way thing not a 
Three day fling 
No secrets kept, no truth betrayed 
And here's the house that held 
The nightmare that went on 
And you're sitting there wishing you'd never been born 
With that self-inflicted crown of thorns 

We do not lie side by side 
and mock the thought of you 
And I don't take her hand and ask 
Is this what he used to do? 
'Cos I just want to free her from 
Your jails of jealous dreams 
'Cos at least a house when it's empty 
Stays clean 
F   C       G 
 I won't pretend 
              F              C            G
That I'm the saviour of the innocent and bad 
              F           C                   G
But put two withered old blooms in a couple of rooms 
             F            C
And they'll behave like lunatics 
     G                      Dm
and crave what makes them sad 


So here's a card that says 
Happy twenty-second birthday and I wish you were dead 
And here's a house that held 
a bevy of devils and an angel as well 
And you want what I've got 
When all I've got is guilt 
And a room that won't stay still 
Filled with pockets full of crumpled up money and 
a mantelpiece littered with bills 
         Dm       C              G
'Cos at least a house when it's empty 
          Dm       C             G
Yeah at least a house when it's empty 
    Dm       C              G             Dm
at least a house when it's empty   is   clean
