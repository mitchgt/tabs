verse 1 
[A]Come back baby bird with your [D]dirty wings in tatters

[Fm]Sleep through the morning light with your arms [E]around your brother

now outside faces cry with tears of lonsesome orphans 
And behind every mask is the face of another 
Wherever you have been Wherever you took cover 
No arms that pulled you in could hold you like your mother 

chorus 

interlude (just use verse chords) 

verse 3 
When all my colors fade and my wings, theyve turned to leather 
Ill know the reasons why God let me get older 
When all my days are through and I fly these hills no longer 
Ill lay beneath the stars and Ill watch you flying over 

chorus (with last line being "you will never be all alone")
