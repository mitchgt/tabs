When the Beatles hit America

Due to a miracle marketing strategy
Beyond the realms of reasonable possibility
It is announced simultaneously
On radio, compact disc, and CD
That John, Paul, George, and Ringo
They're going to be reforming as the Beatles in 1993

And things skip into action immediately
George buys the film rights in a flurry of activity
Paul says they're not going to play Japan
Ringo cancels his chat show plans
John who was never the quiet one
John stays silent for the time being

And the world sings
When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America
They're gonna be sponsored by Visa
When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America

Lawyers start to draw up large contracts
Involving sponsorships T-Shirt deals and Michael Jackson
They're interviewed on live TV
About management deals and corporate policy
And who's going to be the manager of Beatles, PLC?
The manager is made up of cloned parts of
Colonel Tom Parker, Richard Nixon, Donald Trump
And of course George wants the Maharisha

Finally they make it into the studio
They're going to be co-produced by, guess what?
George Martin and Jeff Lynne
Ringo is disappointed to find
That no one needs him anymore except for the vibe
Because he's been sampled
He is now available in the Great Drummer Sample series
For 9.99 available from your local corner shop
Compatible with your cheapest available possible personal computer
The irony is it plays in time

The Who ,the Stones, Debbie Gibson, and ...
Record a supergroup single at very great cost
But it's hard to make the charts
Because everyone's taken the new Beatles to heart
From the day of the announcement
To the day of the big reunion gig at Shea Stadium
Every record in the Top 40 on both sides of the Atlantic
For three whole years is by Lennon and McCartney
Except "Something" which was George Harrison's only good one

And the world sings
When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America
It's gonna be sponsored by Greenpeace as well
When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America

George gets Monty Python in to do some vocals
Linda takes a lot of photos
For a book that is sold out
Before she even thought of putting it out

John who is never the quiet one
John makes all his press contributions
By quoting from his own songs in tune
In time with the backing track behind him
And when somebody asks him what its like in the studio
He says, well "It's been a hard day's night!"
No one understands him
He always was the cryptic one

When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America

Finally the record hits the shelves
It's called "The Beatles: From Ourselves"

For anyone who didn't know
It sounded quite a lot like ELO
Or ELP or FYC or REM or XTC
It sounded a lot like XTC
It didn't sound much like PSI
It didn't sound much like "P.S. I love you"

And finally the day before the big gig at Shea the word gets around
People are saying that they're not going to play
The whole thing's been an insurance scam
To get the reissues selling again
A very cynical attitude
But I expect the money is making interest in someone's bank account

Then we're over at the stadium
Over to you, Roger:
The lights go down
The screaming stops
You could hear a pin drop

And suddenly there they are
And I get scared as they go into "I Saw Her Standing There"
They crash through the best set in the world
Encore with the whole of Sgt. Peppers in order
They're Gods and I'm in Heaven
But on the very last chord of "A Day in the life"
The Beatles are beamed off into outer space
By a waiting spaceship which takes them to a better place
A place where no one knows them
A place where reunions are not expected of anyone
Not even the Buzzcocks

This is my dream
I bought it
I bought the product
You can believe what you like
But it happened folks
Alright that's why I'm singing that

When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America

When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America

The protest lives on that's what they say

When the Beatles hit America
When the Beatles hit America
