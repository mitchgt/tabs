hatful of rain 
(Currie/Harvie/Slaven) 
(intro)
A   D A   F#m  D A

A                   D       A
Love hearts on an old stone building
F#m               D A
Have no relevance now
A                    D            A
Cherry bottles in a bus stop litter bin
F#m                  D A
Remind me of you somehow
A           D         A
You look so young its frightening
F#m                 D A
Life's been good to you
A                        D    A
Strike me down with bolts of lightning 
F#m                     D A
If I wasn't good to you too

D        A     D         A
Throw me away  Throw me away
    C#m           D9                D9 A D9
Cos I don't mind, I'm still satisfied
E                      A
With just a hatful of rain

A   D A F#m   D A

(verse chords)
Merry widows in stock gloss magazines 
Dumbstruck open their mouths 
And out comes some old jackpot philosophy -- 
Everything must pay somehow 
And I've heard you say that he just works for me, 
Doing things that you can't do 
But grease my palms with a hatful of currencies 
I don't belong to you 
  D        A       D          A
Throw me away, throw me away again 
        C#m         D9             D9 A D9
'Cos I don't mind, I'm still satisfied 
E                      A
With just a hatful of rain 

A   D A F#m   D A
A   D A B  D

    C#m           D9                   D9 - E9   
Yeah I don't mind, I'm still satisfied
                          D9 - E9
With just a hatful of rain
