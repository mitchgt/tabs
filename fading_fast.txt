Fading Fast

E           A
If I ran so far
        F#                B 
That my life can't follow me
E                 A
Would it keep the world 
            F#        B
From up and swallowing me
A                   B                 E               A
There's so much to weigh me down that I can't hardly breathe
C#m                 F#
And I don't want to think about it 
C#m                   F#
But I don't want this pain to last
    E  B          C#m
And I  I'm fading fast


E                A
If I didn't look back 
      F#         B
And I changed my name 
E               A        F#          B
Would I find my new life exactly the same
A                 B                 E          A
I'm looking at an empty future that I already blame
C#m                 F#
And I don't want to think about it 
C#m                   F#
But I don't want this pain to last
    E  B          C#m
And I  I'm fading fast


A
I've put it all behind me 
A
Just to have it one day find me 
A                              B
And now I'm just this far from gone


Solo 


A                  B             E                 A
And so I'm leaving here on every cent that I could borrow
A                    F#            B
Lord only knows just where I'll be tomorrow
    C#m              F#
And I don't want to think about it 
    C#m               F#
But I don't want this pain to last
    E     B 
And I I'm fading 
C#m             F#
I don't want to think about it 
      C#m             F#
But I don't want this pain to last
    E B   C#m    F#
And I I'm fading fast 
    E  B   C#m    F#          C#m F#  A E
Yea I  I'm fading fast
