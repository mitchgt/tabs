[D]The ashtray says
[D]You were up all night
[G]When you went to bed
[Gm]With your darkest mind
[D]Your pillow wept
[D]And covered your eyes
[G]You finally slept
[Gm]While the sun caught fire
[D]You've changed

[D]We fell in love
[D]In the key of C
[G]We walked along
[Gm]Down by the sea
[D]You followed me down
[D]The neck to D
[G]and fell again
[Gm]Into the sea
[D]You changed
[G]Oh, You've [D]changed

[D]Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
[D]Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
[D]Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
[D]Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
[D]Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
[G]Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm
[G]Maybe all I need is a shot in the arm

[D]Something in my veins
[D]Bloodier than blood
[D]Something in my veins
[D]Bloodier than blood
[D]Something in my veins
[D]Bloodier than blood
[D]Something in my veins
[D]Bloodier than blood

[D]The ashtray says
[D]You were up all night
[G]When you went to bed
[Gm]With your darkest mind
[D]You changed
[G]Oh,You've [D]changed
[D]What you once were isn't what
You want to be any more
What you once were isn't what
You want to be any more
What you once were isn't what
You want to be any more
What you once were isn't what
You want to be any more
What you once were isn't what
You want to be any more
