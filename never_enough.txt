Never Enough


intro:   Am  D   x2

     Am          D      Am               D
With two hundred people in suits all the same
    Am            D           Am          D
You walk off that last lonely train.
       Am            D         Am            D
On the half finished buildings only seagulls remain
       Am           D                        Am       D    Am
As you try to think back to the root of this pain.


    D                Am     D                Am
And life ain't worth living without a little love
             D             Am
But a little love is never enough.


So some folks are fighting for freedom but you're just fighting the flab
And therein lies the fact that life is a drag
So you gaze at the television
As some publicity goons cut loose those useless balloons.


    D                Am     D                Am
And life ain't worth living without a little love
             D             Am
But a little love is never enough.



E                            Am           D
Down in the darkness of your lying little heart
F                          Am
There's a space for you to change
           D               E
So you can take this world apart.


And these days the morning mirror seems to say to you now,
That you used to be pretty but you're alright now.
And sometimes you find you're dreaming as you're late for work again
Thinking there's not many trees you can see from this train.


D                Am
Life ain't worth living
D                Am
Without a little love
D                          Am
But a little love is never enough.
E                        Am   G   D
Life ain't worth living
N.C.
Without a little love
D                          Am
But a little love is never enough.

D    Am  til end
