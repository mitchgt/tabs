[: A | D E :]

Well [A] I'm going out 
I'm [D] going out [E] looking for a [A] cynical girl 
Who's [D] got no [E] use for the [A] real world 
I'm [D] looking for a [E] cynical [A] girl [D] [A] [E]

Well I hate TV 
There's gotta be somebody other than me 
Who's ready to write it off immediately 
I'm looking for a cynical girl 

Well I'll [G] know right away by the [A] look in her eye 
She [G] harbors no illusions and she's [A] worldly-wise   
And I'll [D] know [G] when I [E] give her a listen that [D] she [G]  
She's what [E] I've been missing
What I've been missing

I'll be lost in love 
And having some fun with my cynical girl 
Who'll have no use for the real world 
I'm looking for a cynical girl
