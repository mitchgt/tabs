Box Full of Letters

D lick x 2

[D] Got a [A] box full of [G] letters [Em]
Think you might like to [G] read
[D] Some [A] things that you [G] might like to see but they're [Em]
All addressed to [G] me
[D] Wish I [A] had a lot of [G] answers [Em]
That's the way it should [G] be
[D] For [A] all these [G] questions [Em]
Being directed at [G] me

I just [D] can't find the [A] time
To write my [G] mind
The way I want it to [D] read [lick]

[A] You'll come [D] back again [G] [D] [A]
And I'll still [D] be your friend [G] [D] [A]

I got a lotta your records
In a separate stack
Some things that I might like to hear but I
Guess I'll give them back
Wish I had a lot of answers
That's the way it should be
For all these questions
Being directed at me

I just can't find the time
To write my mind
The way I want it to read [lick]

[A] You'll come [D] back again [G] [D] [A]
And I'll still [D] be your friend [G] [D] [A]

[solo]
D A G Em G
D A G Em G
D A G

I just [D] can't find the [A] time
To write my [G] mind
The way I want it to [D] read

I just [D] can't find the [A] time
To write my [G] mind
The way I want it to [D] read [lick]

(you'll come back again chords) [D]
