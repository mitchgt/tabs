surface of the moon

E                         B
Snow in a soulless city
A                               B
Covers up the tracks in the road
C#min                           B
As a wastrel buys her cigarettes
A                         B
And wipes her pretty nose
E                               B
Like a part-time Elvis imitator
A                           B
These streets I knew so well
            C#min                  B
Have been pasted beyond recognition
A
With a temporary smell
        G#min
Now the midnight train eases out
           B             A
Leaving everyone marooned
           C#min
And for all I care
   A
It might as well be the surface of the moon

(Intro riff x2)

So from the well-swept streets of Jackson Heights
To the dockside drudgery
Everything is now a replica
Of what it used to be
But since they tarted up the trenches
And painted the bridges blue
It seems less like a home to me
Than just a place they bury you

Now we're lit up like a cathedral
In our frozen concrete room
And without her 
It might as well be the surface of the moon

        A                       B
So I need her and I love her
           C#min
That is true
           A                               B
But I'm stuck here like some shipwreck
                C#min
Instead of holding on to you
                A
When they beat out the tramps

And pack up the slums
B                          C#min        
Everything will be fine
                   G#min
There'll be a new facade
                        C#min
For us to hide behind

So on the ancient trails of our coupling
In the places we used to meet
I am amazed by the lack of memories
That I thought would flood through me
And the riverside where we first kissed has now been reduced
To a phony old world market where only shoppers get seduced

Now your arms embrace me strangely in your unfamiliar room
And for all I care it might as well be the surface of the moon Yeah for
all I care it might as well be the surface of the moon
