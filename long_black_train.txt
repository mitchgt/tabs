Josh Turner - Long Black Train

 ----->(Capo 3rd fret)<-----

Intro - G - 


(verse 1)
G
There's a long black train, comin down the line,
                               Em       G
Feeding off the souls that are lost and cryin'
G
Rails of sin only evil remains,
                            D           G
Watch out brother for that long black train,


(verse 2)
G
Look to the heaven's you can look to the sky,
                               Em             G
You can find redemption starin back into your eyes,
G
There is protection and there's peace the same,
                              D           G
Burn in your ticket for that long black train,


(chorus)
G
Cause there's victory in the Lord I say,
                D
Victory in the Lord,
Em            G             C    G
Cling to the father and his holy name,
    Em       G             D           G
And don't go ridin on that long black train,


(Verse 3)
G
There's an engineer on that long black train,
                         Em                G
Makin you wonder if your ride is worth the pain,
G
He's just a waitin on your heart to say,
                     D           G
Let me ride on that long black train


(chorus)
G
Cause there's victory in the Lord I say,
                D
Victory in the Lord,
Em            G             C    G
Cling to the father and his holy name,
    Em       G             D           G
And don't go ridin on that long black train,


(lead - G - Em - G - D - G)


(verse 4)
G
Well I can hear the whistle from a mile away,
                        Em        G
It sounds so good but I must stay away,
G
That train is a beauty makin everybody stare,
                                  D         G
But its only destination is the middle of nowhere,


(chorus)
G
Cause there's victory in the Lord I say,
                D
Victory in the Lord,
Em            G             C    G
Cling to the father and his holy name,
    Em       G             D           G
And don't go ridin on that long black train,
Em            G             C    G
Cling to the father and his holy name,
    Em       G             D           G
And don't go ridin on that long black train,
     Em       G                D          G
Yea watch out brother for that long black train,
      Em       G         D          G
That devil's drivin that long black train,

instead of playing a G try G6... i think that it sounds alot better...  G6 is just 320000..

Driller, I tried it out with a G6, 
but I really think it's just a straight G.
Maybe if the high E was dropped down to D?
Thanks for the suggestion though.

I was watching the video and this is exactly how he plays the song, great job!

Comment by: LennyB | 1/24/2004

I think the second G should be a D.  i played G  Em  then D and it 
sounded pretty good.  Tahnks for the post, any suggestions on how to 
sing that low???  :)


Comment by: davidlovesemily | 2/11/2004

Hard to sing? Too low? I agree.  I transposed to key of C and kapo up 
to my key.In C the chords are C Am G (play F on word "holy" in 
chorus).Not all of us can be Josh Turner.  God bless..

Hey man, great tab... I just thought i would let you know about how 
much this kid sounds like our very own australian adam harvey! For 
those of you who have heard adam sing, youll know what im talkin 
about...anyway, its a bloody great song, and keep bringing the tabs 
man


Comment by: debeck | 2/15/2004

Hey, thanks for the comments guys!
davidlovesmily, I tried it in the key
of C and I really like it there. that 
works out MUCH better if I'm attempting 
that song myself. haha I just can't go
that low no matter how bad I want to.
Thanks alot for the tip!

Not being picky or anything, but shouldn't it be capo second fret?  The original is in the Key of A I believe.  And if you play a G with the capo on the third it would be A#.  If you meant to do it thats fine.  But if it is supposed to sound like Palaminos it should be capo second with the same chords that you have.


Comment by: debeck | 3/22/2004

Palamin0's tab is actually in the key of A
with capo on the first fret. That's why you
see it transposed here with the capo on 3.
So you're right, the original would actually
have been in A#. You could put the capo on 2
though. If that suits your voice bettter. But
to play it with the recording it's gotta be on
3 with these chords.
