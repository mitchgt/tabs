Oh My Sweet Carolina 

This is basically the same as the previous version, but I've changed
the chords relative to the capo at the second fret, and I've made an
attempt at the intro (which is used a few times in the song) as
well as the little piano interlude after the 2nd chorus....

Verse 1
    C                         F                C
I went down to Houston and I stopped in San Antone
    C                            G
I passed up the station for the bus
      F                 C               Am               F
Was trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
          C          G               C
Man I ended up with pockets full of dust 
Verse 2 (same chords): 
So I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane
Bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance
I was spendin' money like the way it likes to rain
Man I ended up with pockets full of cane
 
Chorus:
      Am  F      C      Am       F           G
Oh my swe-eet Carolina, what compels me to go
      Am  F         C              Am      G         F
Oh my swe-eet disposition, may you one day carry me home 

(repeat intro) 

Verse 3: 
I ain't never been to Vegas but I gambled up my life
Building newsprint boats I raced to sewer mains
Trying to find me something but I wasn't sure just what
Funny how they say that some things never change 

(repeat chorus) 

(piano break)
Am F C G x3
C C/B Am G F 

Verse 4: 
Up here in the city, it feels like things are closin' in
The sunset's just my light bulb burning out
I miss Kentucky and I miss my family
All the sweetest winds they blow across the south 

(repeat chorus)
