I hear the train a-comin'; it's rollin' 'round the bend, 
G                                              G7 
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when, 
C7                                             G 
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison and time keeps draggin' on. 
D7                                     G 
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone. 

	
2. When I was just a baby, my momma told me, "Son, 
Always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns." 
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die. 
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry. 

3. I bet there's rich folk eatin'in a fancy dining car. 
They're prob'ly drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars, 
But I know I had it comin', I know I can't be free, 
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me. 

4. Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine, 
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line, 
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay, 
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away.

I think Cash' recording goes E - A - B7, otherwise this is correct, of course.

Subject: TAB:  Fulsom Prison Blues 

Well no one has requested this but here are the riffs 
from Johnny Cash's "Fulsom Prison Blues".  I'd like to 
see tab/chords for any of his other songs, particularly 
"Ring of Fire."    All mistakes are mine alone ... Kevin 


h    = hammer 
p    = pull off 
b    = bend
