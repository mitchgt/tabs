Beyond the Blues (acoustic)
Peter Case

Here's one I've been fooling around with from Peter Case's new album of acoustic versions of mostly his older songs. This one's much better than the original electric version and is excellent live. It's the one he usually does out in the middle of the audience, off mic. Great tune.

Verse 1:
D G D
The old man on the corner is singin’ my life

Playin’ guitar with a rusty old knife
D G
Each line that he sings rhymes with the truth
D A G
The promise of something beyond the blues

Beyond the blues

Verse 2:
Now you and me darlin’ we took the long way around
‘Cross the wide open country, Past the heart attack town
To this fork in the road where we’ve all got to choose
Between darkness and life beyond the blues
Beyond the blues

Chorus:
G D
Beyond the shadows and the rain
A D
Beyond the darkness and all the pain
G D
When you know in your heart no way out but through
A D
Take a walk with me darlin’ beyond the blues

Verse 3:
The old man on the corner has been gone for years
His guitar and his knife are all rusty with tears
But there’s a song that he gave us that we’ll never have to lose
About another life waitin’ beyond the blues

Chorus:
Beyond the shadows and the rain
Beyond the darkness and all the pain
When you know in your heart no way out but through
Take a walk with me darlin’ beyond the blues
Love is the road that leads beyond the blues
