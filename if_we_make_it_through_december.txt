If we make it through [C] December
Everything's gonna be alright I [G] know [G/F#] [Em]
It's the coldest time of [Am] winter [D]
And I shiver when I see the falling [G] snow

If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December we'll be fine

Got laid off down at the factory
And their timing's not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
I wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl

I don't mean to hate December
it's meant to be the happy time of year
But my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be alright I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow

If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
if we make it through December we'll be fine
