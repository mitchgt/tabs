Smelly Cat  Phoebe from the Show "Friends"

Chords:  Em  (022000)  A (x02220)  D (xx0232)

Em          A          D    A         Em
Smelly Cat Smelly Cat  What are they feeding you
Smelly Cat Smelly Cat  It's not your fault

Em                  A
They won't take you to the vet
       D         A        Em
You're obviously not their favorite pet
Em                      A
You may not be a bed of roses
           D  A                    Em
And you're no friend to those with noses

Chorus and verses again as you wish
