A Magazine Called Sunset

There's a [D] magazine called [G] Sunset
And a [Bm] tape machine that [E] won't let
Me [G] ever forget this [Bb] impossible longing for [D] you [A]

Let's [D] take a map across your pillow
And [E] breathe the sky in through your window
I'll [G] stay in the riddle and [Bb] watch your books cave [D] in [A]

Oh [D] maybe you're my inspiration
Just [E] lead me to some new sensation
I'll [G] make a little guide they can [Bb] call our [D] own [A]

There's a [D] magazine called [G] Sunset
And a [Bm] tape machine that [E] won't let
Me [G] ever forget this [Bb] impossible longing for [D] you [A]
