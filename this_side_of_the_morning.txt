this side of the morning 
(Currie) 
capo on 2nd fret

2 x D Dsus4 G A D Dsus4 G A

D   D6sus4 G       A           D
  Nobody's perfect, and that's something

          D6sus4  G      A
  that I'm sure   she'll know

        D                  D6sus4        G        A
  Cause trying to tell her lies from the truth at times

          F#                        G   G9
  is like trying to divide ice from snow

D            D6sus4      G   A   D            D6sus4
  And when I knew it was over, I jumped into a taxi

            G             A
  And said "Guess were to go"

          D             D6sus4
  And the driver turned about and said,

   G                A
  "Finding what you want is like

  F#                        G    G9
  Trying to divide ice from snow"



     A      A9   G               G9
  So here I sit, rolling back to bed

          A
  Knowing love is a hazard

  D6sus4       G      G9
  That I never guessed

           D    D9sus4    D6sus4
  But from this side  of  morning

     D9sus4       A    A7 A6sus4  A             D    INTRO twice
  I couldn't care less,        I  couldn't care less.



D   D6sus4 G       A
  Nobody's helpless, although

      D      D6sus4    G          A
  I've never felt this helpless before

      D            D6sus4       G             A
  And trying to persuade myself not to think about her

          F#                            G       G9
  Is like trying to tell the clouds not to pour

D          D6sus4       G
  And so I put down the bottle

A             D               D6sus4
  While in my head time is collapsing

          G            A
  And the currents run cold

     D              D6sus4
  So I can curse her memory

      G         A               F#
  But don't try telling me that she was not

                  G
  An emerald in a mountain of coal

          G9        F#
  Or that there's a crock of cures for cancer

         G            G9
  At the end of the rainbow.



     A      A9   G               G9
  So here I sit, rolling back to bed

          A
  Knowing love is a hazard

  D6sus4       G      G9
  That I never guessed

           D    D9sus4   D6sus4
  But from this side  of morning

    D9sus4        A    A7 A6sus4  A7
  I couldn't care less,


      A                                   G
  And she's the kind of girl who won't forgive

              D
  But will forget

     G
  So take my from this party, driver

  A
  put me back to bed

    A                               G              D
  I wanted to be loved but just got laughed at instead

     G                   A  A9
  So if this taxi is for hire

           G
  I'll get in the back

                   G9                            A A7 A6sus4 A
  Just to tell the friction of the tarmac and the tyres.



INTRO twice

D      D6sus4 G      A            D
  So nobody's perfect, and that's something that

      D6sus4 G       A
  I'm sure    she'll know

      D            D6sus4
  And trying to persuade myself

  G             A
  Not to think about her is like

  F#                                 G   G9
  Trying to tell the crockels not to crow

          F#
  Or like trying to tell the striker

         G               G9
  Not to think about the goal.


     A      A9   G               G9
  So here I sit, rolling back to bed

          A
  Knowing love is a hazard

  D6sus4       G      G9
  That I never guessed

           D    D9sus4   D6sus4   D9sus4
  But from this side  of morning

           D    D9sus4   D6sus4   D9sus4
  Yea from this side  of morning

           D    D9sus4   D6sus4   D9sus4
  Yea from this side  of morning       I

  A    A7 A6sus4  A
couldn't care less


D D6sus4 G A - D
