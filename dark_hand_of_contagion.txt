It wasn't the wrath of God
Or the dark hand of contagion
Not some cruel comedy
Or a botched up engraving

I met you at Acadia
I tried wine and persuasion
It was just another dinner bought
By the dark hand of contagion

You drew it like a map in sand
Led us down the road to ruin
You said you tried to understand
You'd no idea what I was doing

Your wedding day was so well planned
Like a German occupation
I signed the note on your nightstand
'The Dark Hand of Contagion'

It said it's not too late
You still got time
And I hold that time like a handful of the sea
So you won't get rid of me so easily

It wasn't the wrath of God
I guess he was busy elsewhere
I took you 'round the family plot
Thought you might at least pretend to care

I would have given anything
Made any arrangement
Just to see you wear my ring
On the dark hand of contagion

I would have given anything
Made any arrangement
Just to see you wear my ring
On the dark hand of contagion
