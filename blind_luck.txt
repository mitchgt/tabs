Here comes Blind Luck, swingin his cane
I wonder what he's gonna try and pull today
He's always got a trick or two up his sleeve
I've seen him play a few tricks you wouldn't believe

Now here comes Blind Luck, he's calling your name
He's got a new set of rules to a brand new game
He's gonna make an offer that you can't refuse
He's got a way of knowin whose got something to lose

You can hedge your bets
Or you can play the odds
You can deal with the Devil
Or you can go with God
It's anybody's game
When that wheel starts to spin
Somebody's gonna lose
Somebody else wins

-solo-

Now here comes Blind Luck, he's your long lost friend
When the stakes are right he's always back again
Tappin on your shoulder while you wait your turn
Standing in your corner when there's money to burn

So you bet it all
On the black 13
Then you close your eyes
And you start to dream
Of a brand new chance
In a far off town
Then your hands start shakin
As the wheel slows down

-solo-

Now here comes Blind Luck in his new pair of shades
A pocket full of money somebody else made
A new white suit and a french silk tie
He's crossing against the traffic with his head held high

And all the evidence
Points to Providence
While your common sense
Says coincidence
When the deal goes down
and the lost are found
Whether you win or lose
That's the blind luck blues
