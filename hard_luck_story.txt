Chorus 

Well I was sittin I was drinkin on a barstool thinkin
How true love becomes a lie 
And I never shoulda left you 
But I had to and I bet you there's a man there with you tonight 
And I swore to your daddy that I missed you but I didn't 
If I came back it wouldn't be right 
Cuz I can leave you if I want a little baby and I'm gonna tonight
