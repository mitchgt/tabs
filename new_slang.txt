[: Am - C - F - C - G - C - Am - G - Am - C - F - C - G - C - Am - G :] 

[Am] Gold teeth and a [C] curse for this [F] town
were [C] all in my [G] mouth
only [C] I don't know [F] how they got [Am] out, [G] dear
[Am] Turn me back [C] into the [F] pet
I [C] was when we [G] met
I was [C] happier [F] then with no [Am] mind [G] set

And if you took to [C] me like
a [F] gull [C] takes to the wind [G], well
I'd have jumped from [C] my tree
and [F] I'd have [C] danced like the [F] king of the [C] eyesores
and the [F] rest of our [C] lives would have [G] fared well

[Am] New slang when you [C] notice the [F] stripes
the [C] dirt in your [G] fries
Hope it's [C] right when you [F] die
old and [Am] boney [G]
[Am] Dawn breaks like a [C] bull through the [F] hall
[C] never should have [G] called
but my [C] head's to the [F] wall
and I'm [Am] lonely [G]

And if you'd a took to [C] me like
a [F] gull [C] takes to the [G] wind, well
I'd have jumped from [C] my tree
and [F] I'd have [C] danced like the [F] king of the [C] eyesores
and the [F] rest of our [C] lives would have [G] fared well

[Am] God speed all the [C] bakers at [F] dawn
may they [C] all cut their [G] thumbs
and bleed [C] into their [F] buns
till they [Am] melt [G] away

I'm looking in on the [C] good life
I might be [F] doomed [C] never to [G] find
without a [G] trust or flaming [C] fields
am I [F] too [C] dumb to [G] refine?
And if you took to [C] me like, well
[F] I'd have [C] danced like [F] the queen of the [C] eyesores
and the [F] rest of our [C] lives would have [G] fared well
