Jesus and Elvis 

[G] Jesus and Elvis painted on [C] velvet [D] hanging at the bar here every [G] night
It’s good to be back again, me and my [C] old friends
Beneath a [D] neon cross and a string of Christmas [G] lights

[Em] Lola built this [C] joint in ’67 [G] and her [Em] boy went off to [C] fight on Christmas [D] Eve
In a [Am] war nobody won, she [G] lost her only [Em] son
Now [A] everything he loved is what you [D] see

Beneath a [D] neon cross and a string of Christmas [G] lights

[Em] Mama told him [C] Jesus loves a [G] sinner
His [Em] daddy said that [C] music saved his [D] soul
Between the [Am] drunkards and the band, it’s a [G] fitting promise [Em] land
For the [A] King of Kings and the King of Rock n’ [D] Roll

[G] Jesus and Elvis painted on [C] velvet [D] hanging at the bar here every [G] night

So if you [Em] need a shot of [C] whiskey and [G] redemption
Where the [Em] delta meets the [C] Sea of Galilee [D] 
Get [Am] washed in the blood of the [G] Mississippi [Em] mud
Come [A] all you non-believers and you’ll [D] see

Beneath a [D] neon cross and a string of Christmas [G] lights

By and [D] by Lord by and [G] by
