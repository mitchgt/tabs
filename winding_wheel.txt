[Cadd2/G]                                                      
Well night time let her through yeah I'm talking to you, wanna see her 

[Cadd2/G]                                                      [G] [Cadd2/G] [G]
Precious little thing with eyes that dance around without their clothes

[Am11]                    [Bm*]                   [Csus2]                   [Am*]
So buy a pretty dress and wear it out tonight for anyone you think could outdo me 

    [Csus2] [G]   [Cadd2/G]      [G]     [Cadd2/G][G] 
Oh, better still, be my winding wheel  

Cause I feel just like a map without a single place to go of interest 
I'm further north than south if I could shut my mouth she'd probably like this 
So buy a pretty dress and wear it out tonight for all the boys you think could outdo me 
Oh, better still, be my winding wheel 

Well children laugh and sing the song that ushers in the driving rain 
I'm standing in the station like some old record, waiting on a train 
So buy a pretty dress and wear it out tonight for anyone you think could outdo me 
Oh, better still, be my winding wheel
