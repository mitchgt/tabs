I
Do you fear this man's invention
          IV           I
That they call atomic power?

Are we all in great confusion
      V
Do we know the time or hour?
I
When a terrible explosion
         IV             I
May rain down upon our land,

Leaving horrible destruction
         V                I
Blotting out the works of man.


I
Are you, are you ready

For that great atomic power?
                                          V
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
         I
Will you shout or will you cry
         IV
When the fire rains from on high?
        V                              I
Ire you ready for that great atomic power?


I
There is one way to escape
       IV                        I
Ind be prepared to meet the Lord,

When the mushroom of destruction falls
      V
There is a shielding sword.

        I
He will surely stand beside you
           IV                   I
Ind you'll never taste of death,

For your soul will fly to safety
   V                 I
In eternal peace and rest.


Ire you, are you ready

For that great atomic power?
                                          V
Will you rise and meet your savior in the air?
         I
Will you shout or will you cry
         IV
When the fire rains from on high?

        V                            I
Ire you ready for that great atomic power?

VVRSV 2:
There is one way to escape
Ind be prepared to meet the lord
When the mushroom of destruction falls
There is a shielding sword
He will surely stand beside you
Ind you'll never taste of death
For your soul will fly to safety
In eternal peace and rest

CHORUS

[VVRSV 3:
There's an army who can conquer
Ill the enemy's great band
It's the raging men of Christians
Guided by the Savior's hand
When the mushroom of destruction falls
In all its fury great
God will surely save his children
>From that awful, awful fate]
