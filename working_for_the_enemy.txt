Peter Case - Working For The Enemy
From: Torn Again (1995 - Vanguard Recordings)

Performance notes: Sounds like Peter tuned to E A C# E A E and capoed up one fret

There’s a lot of blue notes struck by the mandolin, so its hard to hear the guitar lick, but I get reasonable results hammering on C# on the high or low A# string, just create your own blues lick. The IV and V chords below are simply barred, though it sounds cool to let the high A# and F strings ring throughout the chord changes.

Thanks to Tabbedout - Jan Kristoffer Dale for the lyrics

1. Verse:
(A#) Living on Chenango, couldn't tell day from night
People in line for gasoline where itchin' for a fight
Out of (D#) school, work & money. Desirous of gain.
I (A#) met this guy named Sonny walking downtown in the rain
He (F) bought a pint of whiskey, and we drank it in his car
(A#) Said the job was risky, but with (D#) luck I might get far

Ch:
(D#) You don't know it but it's a plain to see.
You can't tell if your working for your enemy
You can't tell if your (F?) working for your ene(A#)my

2. Verse:
Down on the south side, Deserted part of time.
Hangers, docks and factories. Where the signs are falling down.
The boy's had finished loading, rain where dripping from their hats.
They where joking, they where boasting. They looked like water rats.
With a sixteen wheeler full of stolen goods.
Me and Sonny supposed to drive in south. They stuck a cigar in my mouth.

Ch:
(D#) You don't know it but it's a plain to see.
You can't tell if your working for your enemy
You can't tell if your (F?) working for your ene(A#)my
Your ene(F)my don't care if you're (D#) falling (A#).
Your ene(F)my - he don't care (C#) if you ever hear (D#) your heart callin(A#)'.

3. Verse:
Chased by the cops in Cleveland, made Louisville the break of day,
Didn’t say four words til Memphis, Sonny didn’t come out to play
We hit town & scattered, the sky was dark & low.
A drink was all that mattered, I found a place to go.
While business was tendered, I met a girl named Linda Lou
We went on a bender, down on Union Avenue.

Ch:
(D#) You don't know it but it's a plain to see.
You can't tell if your working for your enemy
You can't tell if your (F?) working for your ene(A#)my
Your ene(F)my don't care if you're (D#) falling (A#).
Your ene(F)my - he don't care (C#) if you ever hear (D#) your heart callin(A#)'.

4. Verse:
So Linda Lou blew in Sonny & claimed her big reward.
Tok of in the morning in a 67. Ford.
Needles, California. The Galaxy broke down.
Left here on the desert, hitchhiked into town.
Searching for mechanics. Walking by a nice cold bar.
Never saw Linda Lou again, but I found my rising star.

Ch:
(D#) You don't know it but it's a plain to see.
You can't tell if your working for your enemy
You can't tell if your (F?) working for your ene(A#)my
Your ene(F)my don't care if you're (D#) falling (A#).
Your ene(F)my - he don't care (C#) if you ever hear (D#) your heart callin(A#)'.
