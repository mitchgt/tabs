Out the door just in time

Em                      A
I know what I've been told,

Em                           A
You got to work to feed the soul

VERSE TWO-Chords same as V1

You've got your love online
You think you're doing fine
But you're just plugged into the wall

And that deck of tarot cards
Won't get you very far
There ain't no hand to break your fall

Well

CHORUS-
I know what I've been told
You gotta know just when to fold
But I can't do this all on my own
No, I know, I'm no Superman
I'm no Superman

INSTRUMENTAL-Play the verse chords

You've crossed the finish line
Won the race but lost your mind
Was it worth it after all

I need you here with me
Cause love is all we need
Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall
