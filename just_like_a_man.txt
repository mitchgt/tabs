just like a man 
(Currie) 
Intro (difficult to describe, listen to the bass line and play these notes and then the chords with the same rhythm.  I'm working on the slide guitar part)

B -----------------------------------
G -----------------------------------

A -----------------------------------
E 2-2----0-2-2----0-2-2----0-2-2-----

Chords for intro after this     F#m             B


F#m                     B         F#m           B
I still don't believe it, how much we lied
F#m                     B                               F#m                     B
Last night you made it with him, now I'm supposed to be dignified
F#m                             B               F#m                             B
Well I spend my night times drinking and you spend your days in bed 
F#m                     B                       F#m                     B
And I guess it's up to us to choose the methods by which we forget


Pre-chorus
F#m                     B
And just like a man he holds you gently
F#m                     B
And just like a man he strokes your hair
F#m             B
And just like a man I still pretend that I'm
F#m                             B       (fast strum B x3)
Immune to the whole affair

(The first choruses are played slightly different to the last one, but the last one sounds best, if you want to be exact don't change to the A in these, but do change to it in the last one!)

Chorus
                        F#m               A                 D                   B               
But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you I was wrong
                        F#m               A                 D                                   
Yeh I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late
                        B
So I soldier on just like a man

Verse 2

F#m             B                       F#m                     B
I don't believe it, you were easy to leave but now
F#m                     B               F#m                     B
I do my best to relieve it the only way I know how
                        F#m             B
Just like a man

F#m             B                       F#m                     B
And I don't wanna possess you, I don't wanna take his place
F#m                     B                       F#m                     B
But I don't wanna see my last few pleasures written all over his face


Pre-chorus
F#m                     B
And just like a man he holds you gently
F#m                     B
And just like a man he strokes your hair
F#m             B
And just like a man I still pretend that I'm
F#m                             B       (fast strum B x3)
Immune to the whole affair


Chorus
                        F#m               A                 D                   B               
But I wanna die, I wanna cry, I wanna tell you I was wrong
                        F#m               A                 D                                   
Yeh I wanna die, I wanna cry but it's too late
                        B
So I soldier on just like a man

I have absolutely no idea about any of the chords in this bit, sorry.

And I have something to tell you but it doesn't matter now
I'll stick to small talk and leave the little bits of flattery to him
And I could call you but why would I bother to
You might not be in or he might misunderstand
Just like a man
