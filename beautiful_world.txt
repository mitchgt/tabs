G      D                   G
My my my its a beautiful world
C         D             G
I like swimming in the sea
C                 D                  Em
I like to go out beyond the white breakers
C        D                Em
Where a man can still be free or a woman if you are one
C        D              G
I like swimming in the sea

V2
G      D                   G
My my my its a beautiful world
C         D            G
I like drinking Irish tea
C                    D       Em
With a little bit of Lapsan su Chang
C         D           G
I like making my own tea

C         D           G
I like driving in my car
C               D              Em
I roll the top down sometimes I travel quite far
C            D     Em
Drive to the ocean stare up at the stars
C         D           G
I like driving in my car

Chorus/bridge
Em             C     D           G
All around is anger,  automatic guns
Em             C                      D                    G
Death in large numbers no respect for women or our little ones
Em               C      D                 G
Tried talking to Jesus but he just put me on hold
Em                        G
Said he'd been swamped by calls this week
       C                   D
And he could not shake his coooooooooooold

V4
G          D            G
Still this emptiness persists
C               D              G
Perhaps this is as good as it gets
C                          D              Em
When you've given up the drink and those nasty cigarettes
C                   D      Em
Who leaves the party early, leaves with no regrets
C                  D           Em
I watch the sun as it comes up I watch it as it sets
C            D               G
Yeah this is as good as it gets

V5
G      D                   G
My my my its a beautiful world
C          D           G
I like sleeping with Marie


C               D    Em
She is one sexy girl - full of mystery
C                    D       Em
She says she doesn't love me but likes my company
C              D                G
For now that's good enough for me

V6
G      D                   G
My my my its a beautiful world
C          D            G
I like swimming in the sea
C                 D                  Em
I like to go out beyond the white breakers
C        D                 Em
Where a man can still be free or a woman if you are one
C          D            G
I like swimming in the sea
