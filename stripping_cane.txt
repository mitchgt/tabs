Stripping Cane 

 There's no more room for angels
 To dance or even stand
 Upon this pin entangled 
 Bleeding sugar from our hands
 Bleeding ashes from our feet
 Won't you help me count my sheep
 Won't you help me count my sheep tonight 

You make your heart a decoration
 It's like a broken violin
 So carefully made empty
 Taking only silence in
 Taking saccharine to kill your pain
 Won't you help me stripping cane
 Won't you help me stripping cane tonight

Stripping cane for something sweet
 Stripping Cain a man complete is born
 His heart a thing to hold both dark and light
 Stripping cane no tongue can tell
 The silent ring of this empty bell
 Won't you tell me fare thee well
 Fare thee well tonight

I've got nowhere to go now
 I'm like a bird in an eclipse
 And the grammar of our bodies
 Breathing poems to our lips
 Breathing verses out of rhyme
 Won't you help me killing time
 Won't you help me killing time tonight

There's no more room for angels
 To dance or even stand
 Upon this pin entangled 
 Bleeding sugar from our hands
 Bleeding ashes from our feet
 Won't you help me count my sheep
 Won't you help me count my sheep tonight
 Won't you help me count my sheep tonight
 Won't you help me
