[E] Springtime comes, the leaves are back on the trees again
The snappers are harder to see [A] my friends
Weeding out your weekends[E]

Summer comes and gravity undoes you
You're happy because the lovely way the sunshine bends[A]
Hiding from your close friends weeding out your week[E]ends

[A]Candy leftover from Hal[B]loween
The [E]unified theory of [A]everything
[A]Love left over from [B]lovers leaving
[E]Books they all know [A] they're not worth reading
It's not for the [E] season

Autumn comes you sit in your chair and stare at the tv square
Hiding all your feelings weeding out the weekends

Winter comes and the days all start late
There's motion on the bows where the dark shapes prowl
Feeling up the feeling Feeling out of feeling

chorus
