Chorus:

Hey [C] bury me, [F] along the big sandy

[C] Down in those Blue Grass [G] mountains.

[C] Rest my soul in those [F] hills of coal

[C] Until this old [G] land doesn't [C] tremble.

[C] Don't you [F] mourn for me when my [C] soul is free

No, [F] woman, don't you [G] cry.

Just [C] bury me, [F] along the big sandy,

[C] Under the [G] blue Kentucky [C] sky.



This old [C] town of sin, it's [F] about to do me in n

I Don't [C] know how much I can [G] stand.

With my [C] knees on the street and my [F] heart at their feet

I'm [C] forced to flee from [G] Satan's hand.


Chorus


When I came to this land I was strong and could stand,

But now I've somehow gone astray.

But I still see the truth and the teaching of my youth

And I know the Lord ain't turned away.


Chorus
