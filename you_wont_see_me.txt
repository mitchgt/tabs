You Won t See Me chords

D A
       A        B7       D        A
When I call you up, your line's engaged.
       A    B7         D       A
I have had enough, so act your age!
        A7       D          Dm             A
We have lost the time, that was so hard to find,
           A       B7       D   A
And I will lose my mind, if you won't see me. (You won't see me)
D   A
You won't see me. (You won't see me)

        A        B7         D       A
I don't know why you should want to hide
      A         B7          D         A
But I can't get through, my hands are tied.
        A7      D       Dm                 A
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say,
          A    B7        D   A
but I can turn away, and you won't see me. (You won't see me)
D   A
You won't see me. (You won't see me)

D6         Dm6                     A
Time after time you refuse to even listen.
B7                   E               E7
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.

           A        B7          D           A
Though the days are few they're filled with tears,
          A      B7     D          A
and since I lost you it feels like years.
        A7       D     Dm                     A
Yes, it seems so long, girl since you've been gone,
           A        B7    D   A
and I just can't go on if you won't see me. (You won't see me)
D   A
You won't see me. (You won't see me)

D6         Dm6                     A
Time after time you refuse to even listen.
B7                   E               E7
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.

           A        B7          D           A
Though the days are few they're filled with tears,
          A      B7     D          A
and since I lost you it feels like years.
        A7        D    Dm                     A
Yes, it seems so long, girl since you've been gone,
           A        B7    D   A
and I just can't go on if you won't see me. (You won't see me)
D   A
You won't see me. (You won't see me)

A   B7            D   A
Ooh ooh la la la  ooh ooh la la la  2x
