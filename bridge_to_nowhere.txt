 C#m                       B          F#m 
Another day breaks and the last one's gone 
A                    E     G#m 
You dig deep just to carry on 
     C#m                    B          F#m 
Your debt's paid off but it don't feel gone 
       A                            E      G#m 
So you slip out the back and you're moving on

I can never figure out how to make a case 
That this don't amount to a fall from grace 
She wants to know can I replace 
This tired wool with satin lace 

                     A                                          E 
She says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
A             E     G#m           C#m   B 
Put it in the past, put it in the past 
   A                              E 
If this is a race then I hope you come last 
A            E                            G#m           C#m   B 
 You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast

Pressure builds till it breaks the dome 
You can build a house you can't build a home 
And it's a fool who believes love is bred in the bone 
And there're no guarantees that you won't get stoned 
Yeah, I'm a fool who believed love is bred in the bone 
And there're no guarantees that I won't get stoned 

Says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
Put it in the past, put it in the past 
If this is a race then I hope you come last 
You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 

F#m       B             F#m    A  E 
  I don't know where it leads, oh no 
G#m   C#m  B  F#m          B           F#m          A        E      G#m C#m B 
All I know...    is that I don't wanna breathe this chemical breeze no more 

C#m B F#m A E G#m 

So another day breaks and the last one's gone 
You dig deep just to carry on 
Your debt's paid off but it don't feel gone 
So you slip out the back and you're moving on 

Says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
Put it in the past, put it in the past 
If this is a race then I hope you come last 
You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
Yeah you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast 
Put it in the past, put it in the past 
If this is a race then I hope you come last 
You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast
