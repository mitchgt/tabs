Miles from the Lightning
(A Song for Townes Van Zandt)

key of F, standard tuning

Darkness on the fenceposts 
And a whistle from a train
Water in the corn rows 
And a window to the rain
Count your miles from the lightning
Lay your money down
Count your blessings against the thunder
Take the thorns out of your crown

Well it's no more highway rolling
No more sundown ride
No more Carolina
No more great divide
The words to keep from dying 
There ain't a man can find
But the words to keep on living
Is what you left behind 

Songs on painted shadows
Bleed on broken roads
Paved from here to heaven
With anything but gold
And anything but simple
It always was your kind
From the straight and narrow running
Along the straightest line

Darkness on the fenceposts 
And a whistle from a train
Water in the corn rows 
And a window to the rain
Count your miles from the lightning
Rest your tired eyes
Count your blessings against the thunder
Kiss the years goodbye
