Evidence

Capo 5th fret

[D] Saturday night the [G] lights are all lit [A] up [G]
There's a [D] bottle of wine beside an [G] overfilled paper [A] cup
And the [D] cigarette she left [G] lit is all [A] burned up [G]
But the [D] heat from where she [G] lay is [A] not

Like smoke from [G] factories [D] we [A] leave our heat behind
Like wound down [G] batteries [D] hearts stop some [A] times

And [D] between these sheets her [G] perfume lingers [A] on [G]
And in a [D] couple of weeks
All the [G] evidence will be [A] gone

Like a [D] dust free patch [G] where a [A] magazine lay [G]
A [D] girl leaves a gap when she [G] goes
But a someone [A] else fill sit up someday

Like smoke from [G] factories [D] we [A] leave ouR heat behind
Like wound down [G] batteries [D] hearts stop some [A] times

[A] She took away the day dream
Leaving [D] nothing but daily [G] life
[Em] She took away almost [A] every thing
But [D] if you look you'll [A] find [G] evidence she left behind

[D] A blue bar of [G] soap left on the [A] sink [G]
And [D] lipstick round the [G] last glass [A] she used to drink
Those [D] burned up books of [G] matches
That [A] she kept [G]
And [D] heat in the [G] mattress where she [A] slept

Like smoke from [G] factories [D] we [A] leave our heat behind
Like wound down [G] batteries [D] hearts stop some [A] times

Like smoke from [G] factories [D] we [A] leave our heat behind
Like wound down [G] batteries [D] hearts stop some [A] times
