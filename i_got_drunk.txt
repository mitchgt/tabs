Just strum the devil out of it ... Bob Ross said that talking about his
paintbrush once, and it's a fitting sentiment

Em        G     D    G
I grabbed me a fifth
Em        G     D    G
I poured me a shot
Em        G     D     G        
I thought about all the things 
Em        G     D     G
that I haven't got
Em        G     D    G
I drank that down and 
Em        G     D    G
I poured me some more
Em     G      D  G                 
I kept on drinking 
Em      G         D
until I felt the floor

D      C        G      D
I got drunk and I fell down
I got drunk and I fell down
I got drunk and I fell down
I got drunk and I fell down  

Of course, any and all suggestions from other pickin' and grinnin'
postcarders (which I would guess would be pretty much about everybody) are
desired.  I'm not totally sure about the D during the verse, but the chorus
feels pretty good.  There are also some lyrics (Granted, this isn't one of
Jay's most insightful songs, but insight isn't foremost on one's mind when
drinking to unconsciousness.  On the other hand, determination, passion, and
even fury are, all of which are found on this magnificent 7") and breaks
that I left out. This is mainly just a rough draft that'd be nice to polish
up with the help of other folks before putting it on the Gumbo page.

Hasta,

Tod
