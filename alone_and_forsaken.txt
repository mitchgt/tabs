Alone and Foresaken
                                                           
We [Am] met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the [E7] meadows were [Am] gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love like the leaves now has [E7] withered and [Am] gone.

The roses have faded there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't [E7] sing any-[Am] more
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the [E7] whippoorwills [Am] cry.

Refrain
[F]Alone and forsaken by [C] fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me please [Am] hold to my hand
Oh [E7] please un [Am] der stand.

Oh where has she gone to oh where can she be
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away.

The darkness is falling the sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to "BAY"
I wonder, I wonder - what she's thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten - without any love.

Refrain
