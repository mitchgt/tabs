Capo III - Chords relative to capo

Em      D       A       x4


I was just bony hands as cold as a winter pole
you held a warm stone out new flowing blood to hold
oh what a contrast you were to the brutes in the halls
my timid young fingers held a decent animal

G          D
Over the ramparts you tossed
G                 D
the scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
G          D                F
tied to a brick sweet as a song
                     C                         D
the years have been short but the days were long


Cool of a temperate breeze from dark skies to wet grass
we fell in a field it seems now a thousand summers passed
when our kite lines first crossed we tied them into knots
and to finally fly apart we had to cut them off


Since then it's been a book
you read in reverse
so you understand less as the pages turn
or a movie so crass and awkwardly cast
that even I could be the star

C     D           F         G
I don't look back much as a rule
C       D               F         G
and all this way before murder is cool
C        D                      G           C
but your memory is here and i'd like you to stay
           D
a warm light on a winter's day

Em      D       A       x6

G          D
Over the ramparts you tossed
G                   D
the scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
G         D               F
tied to brick sweet as a song
                      C                           F
the years have seemed short but the days go slowly by 
          C
two loose kites falling from the sky
F               C                    D
drawn to the ground and an end to flight
