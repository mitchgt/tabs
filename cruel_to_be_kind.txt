Intro: C-Em-F-G (2x)

C                         Em
Oh, I can't stand another heart-ache
           F                     G
Though you say you're my friend, I'm at my wits end
C                    Em                  F     Em
You say your love is bona fide, but that don't coincide
                         F          Em             F          G
With the things that you do, when I ask you, to be nice - you say

CHORUS
             F           G                 Am
You gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure
F           G            Em        Am
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
F           G     Em           Am
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you
G                                   C-Em-F-G
Ba-by, you gotta be cruel to be kind

Well I do my best to understand you (it)
But you still mystify, and I wanna know why
I pick myself up, off the ground
To have you knock me back down, again and again
When I ask you to explain - you say

CHORUS - RIDE  C-A  F-G-Em-Am

Verse 2 - Well I do my best ...

CHORUS (3x) fade
