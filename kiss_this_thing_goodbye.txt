kiss this thing goodbye (Currie) 
Intro: G C/G  (3 times) D7

G                             C/G
It seems like weeks since you looked at me baby
     G                  C/G
Without that look of distaste
G                     C/G
I don't know why your feelings are changing
         D7
But I've seen it in your face
G                    C/G
All these times when our lips were kissing
    G                    D7
Our tongues were telling lies
    G               C/G
And all those signs I've been missing
     A7                  D7
Were right there in your eyes
   C                                       G
So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye
C                         G     C
Let's kiss this thing goodbye

I sometimes feel when we're together baby
Everything has turned out wrong
And I know you feel exactly the same way
But sill we carry on
I've been waiting up by the window
Watching these cars go by
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motion
For the last time tonight
So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye, Let's kis this thing goodbye

Now I'm watching the tunes foul up the sunrise
I'm watching the lights fade away
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door
And you'll stand here and say

Come on babe, let's kiss this thing
Come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye
Better make it sooner than later Before it all turns sour
Don't you know we'd better kiss this thing goodbye, Come on babe, let's kiss this thing
