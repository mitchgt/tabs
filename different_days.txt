*note: The first six chord names aren't necessarily accurate, I just named them
after the two notes you are fretting

Intro:
G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/E
G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/G

G/B            F#/A            E/G      D/F#    C/E
Staring at the pictures of the runaways on the wall
G/B         F#/A            E/G       D/F#       C/G
Seems like, these days, you couldn't run away at all
G/B         F#/A          E/G    D/F#     C/E
Even if you did, what you got to run away tox
        G/B        F#/A          E/G         D/F#    C/G
Just another drunk daddy with a white man's point of view
       G/B      F#/A   E/G        D/F#    C/E
I can see you in my mind's eye, catching light
G/B              F#/A        E/G           D/F#    C/G
Sleep beside the river if we make it out of town tonight
        G/B      F#/A              E/G      D/F#    C/E
You can strip in Portland from the day you turn sixteen
        G/B          F#/A     E/G    D/F#  C/G
You got one thing to sell and benzodiazepine
D                                    Gmaj7                Cadd9
Ten years ago I might have seen you dancing in a different light,
    D             Gmaj7            Cadd9
and offered up my help in different ways,
                          G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/E
but those were different days
                       G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/G
Those were different days


      G/B       F#/A        E/G       D/F#    C/E
Had a girl back home and we shared her single bed
        G/B            F#/A        E/G          D/F#    C/G
When I whispered in her ear, she believed every word I said
       G/B       F#/A       E/G     D/F#        C/E
If she didn't believe, she didn't dare give me slack
         G/B       F#/A          E/G        D/F#   C/G
Or it was "Baby, I love you, get off of my goddamn back"
G/B       F#/A      E/G       D/F#   C/E
Time went by and I left and I left again
G/B           F#/A            E/G     D/F#   C/G
Jesus loves a sinner but the highway loves a sin
    G/B   F#/A       E/G       D/F#    C/E
My daddy told me, I believe he told me true that:
      G/B          F#/A       E/G     D/F#    C/G
"The right thing's always the hardest thing to do"
D                                    Gmaj7          Cadd9
Ten years ago I might have stuck around for another night,
D                   Gmaj7            Cadd9
and used her in a thousand different ways,
                         G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/E
but those were different days
                      G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/G
Those were different days


         D           Gmaj7           Cadd9     G
And the story's only mine to live and die with
     D            Gmaj7         Cadd9  G
The answer's only mine to come across,
        D                  Gmaj7           Cadd9      G
but the ghosts that I got scared and I got high with
              D      Cadd9
look a little lost


D                                     Gmaj7           Cadd9
Ten years ago I might have thought I didn't have the right
   D                  Gmaj7          Cadd9
To say the things an outlaw wouldn't say,
                         G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/E
But those were different days
                      G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/G
Those were different days
                      G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/E
Those were different days

G/B F#/A E/G D/F# C/G
