Intro: D  A  Bm  A  G  D  A  G

  D                     A
I guess we've come full circle
      Bm        A    G
We're strangers once again
     D                  A            G
It's hard to know we'de ever come to this
     D              A                Bm       A         G
It's funny you were sayin how you'll miss the good ole' times
     D              A        G               D
When all along I'm thinkin' you're the one I'll miss

A                           D
Love's a word I never throw around
   A               G                 D
So when I say I'll love you til' the end
    G               A               Bm     D      G
I'm talkin about until the day they lay me in the ground
D               A           G
Love's a word I never throw around

(Intro)


I'd like to think you're leavin' cuz I treated you unkind

But maybe you just found somebody new

But I know the only reason you're leavin me behind

Is you're no longer feelin' the way I feel for you

(Chorus)


Well I'm goin to the country spend some time out in the woods

Countin stars and sleepin all alone

And I can't say for certain it'll do me any good

But its time I grew accustomed to being on my own

(Chorus)
