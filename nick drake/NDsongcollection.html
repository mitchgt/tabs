All the tracks from the three main albums are here, plus the foursongs from the Feb 74 session, and the song <FONT SIZE=2>TIME OF NO REPLY.</FONT> Also includedis a beautifully done lyrics section, accompanied by both new andwell-known photos of Nick and his guitars, and there is a nice foreword byRobert Kirby.<BR><BR>Before passing comment, I should perhaps declare an incidental interest.Having spent years working out the songs for guitar myself, when I heardthere was going to be a book I called Music Sales and offered myassistance; they thought about it for a few weeks before deciding that theywere confident they'd got the right tunings and transcriptions. I hope itgoes without saying that that wouldn't alter my view of it.<BR><BR>So what's it like, technically? On the whole, I feel it's pretty good. It'snice to be able to look at a tuning and a couple of chord diagrams, and beinstantly playing something like a Nick Drake song. Certainly faster andless off-putting than tabs. Of course any but the simplest tunes will lacklittle details, but that's OK - you wouldn't want a page cluttered withchord diagrams for every possible note played. Most of the transcriptionsmatch the tabs I've posted here, which is reassuring.<BR><BR>But it's not all roses. It's my humble opinion, after careful analysis,that eleven of the transcriptions have got the tuning wrong, with effectsvarying from minor to serious. There are a few others which I feel haveirritating faults. And of course, it would have been nice to see more fromthe <FONT SIZE=2>TIME OF NO REPLY</FONT> album. But nonetheless I'd definitely recommend thebook (if you can afford the steep asking price) - it's a lovely piece ofwork which will give tremendous pleasure to any Nick Drake fan who likes totwang a guitar. I just feel that if you're striving for detail and precision (and can copewith tabs) you'll usually benefit from consulting this site. I'd beinterested to know what other guitarists think.<BR><BR>Of course there is not and probably never will be a definitive work that wecan rely on absolutely. The best we can do is a process of gradualimprovement, to which both this book and this site contribute. Maybe inanother twenty-five years...<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>(The book's ISBN is 0-7119-4464-4, and order no. AM92388.
