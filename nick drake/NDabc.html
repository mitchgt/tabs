An apoplectic stroke in1952 forces the Drake family to move to England, settling in Tanworth-in-Arden,south of Birmingham, not far from Stratford-on-Avon. The brick house they live in is called Far Leys. Nick is four years old at the time.<br>   <br>Of Nick's early years it's said that he was much of an observer, spending a lotof time on his own and that he often could be found walking alone by the sea.The traces of his charachteristic melancholy and inwardness seem to lead backto his early childhood. Rodney Drake: <br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"His heart often carried him away. He carried other people's troubles andworries on his shoulders, and was always terribly depressed when somethinghappened to somebody he knew. And he was always the one that friends would cometo with their worries. Of himself he rarely spoke..." (Rasmussen p.51).  </FONT> </UL> <BR><BR>Nick's interest in music awakened at an early stage of his life. Molly and Rodney Drake:<br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"As a baby he loved to conduct. Whenever the music started he would be up out of chair waving his hands. I think at one time that he had an ambition to become a famous conductor. He dearly loved classical music and listened to it all the time. He picked up on the piano quite early and was rather good. He was fascinated by some of the legends and myths incorporated into classical pieces. He loved a good story, even if some of them scared him half to death." (quote from McGrath)</FONT> </UL><br><A NAME="boyd"><FONT SIZE=5>Boyd, Joe  </FONT><br>Born 1943 in Boston. Producer of Nick's two first albums, '<A HREF="NDfive.html">Five Leaves Left</A>' and '<A HREF="NDbryter.html">Bryter Layter</A>'.Boyd was in the sixties the manager and producer of Fairport Convention. Healso produced Pink Floyd's debut single Arnold Layne in 1967. During the seventies and eightes,Boyd has produced various acts, like Richard Thompson, John martyn, EricClapton, 10 000 Maniacs and R.E.M. He is now running the record companyHannibal Records, currently working with a Cuban and a Hungarian female singer. Boyd about Nick Drake:<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Of all the albums I ever made, the two I produced by Nick are the ones I'mmost proud of. I listen to them often because he was extraordinarily good -nothing he ever did was less than striking, and he had the gift of writingmelodies of incredible beauty."

Also the title trackof that album, an instrumental. The title, according to Chas Keep, is "a direpun on the enunciation of BBC weather broadcasters at the time".

In the winter the room is so cold that hetakes the mattress off the bed, drags it near the gas fire, and piles upblankets for warmth. He says he wants to be alone to work. During a couple ofmonths he writes all the songs for the album. <br><br>In the studio, Nick's search for perfection continues. Not satisfied with thesound and the arrangements of violins, he rejects the finished recordings. Thedate of release is postponed until March 5, and then postponed again. Joe Boydand Nick return to the studio. All in all, the recording of the album lastsabout nine months.<br><br>There are no existing outtakes from 'Bryter Layter', indicating that Nick hadno more songs than the ten on the record, but there is also a theory sayingthat he had more songs, but didn't want to play them. The reason being that hewas so proud of the three instrumentals on the record that he was afraid ofbeing forced to leave out any of them in favor of a non-instrumental.<br><br>He doesn't have to worry, though. Producer Joe Boyd and engineer John Woodcalls 'Bryter Layter' the one perfect album they have made, a masterpiece. Boydis now convinced it's going to make Nick Drake a star, but he is wrong. Itdoesn't sell good either. Nick is crushed, although Island Records is satisfiedwith the 15.000 copies sold.<br><br>One critic calls 'Bryter layter' "the most intelligently produced album of itskind I've ever heard", whilst others describe the music as "near perfect" (ZigZag) and " a triumph of eclecticism" (Rolling Stone).<br><br><A NAME="c"></A><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=7>C</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=5>Cale, John </FONT><br>Born 1940 in Garnant, South Wales.

Cale was very enthusiastic and more or less demanded to meet Nick.  He made Boyd phone Nick up there and then to tell him that Cale was on his way in a taxi to see him.
