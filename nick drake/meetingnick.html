This article tells the story from my point of view. It is a bit of a tangled path but some of the nooks and crannies may be of interest to Nick Drake Files readers.<BR><BR>In my teens, in the mid-60's I became interested in the emerging blues-based acoustic folk guitar players and songwriters. I was stimulated by seeing John Renbourn in concert at the teacher's training college opposite my school in Isleworth, West London, when I was about 16. I wanted to find out more about this marvellous music. Les Cousins in Greek St in Soho emerged  as the best place to pick up on what was going on   - also the club in the Horseshoe Hotel, Tottenham Court Road which Pentangle started up, (as I remember) in 1967.<BR><BR>I left school that year and I had just over a year  to spend before going up to Cambridge to read philosophy or Moral Sciences as philosophy was  called then. I decided to use this "year out" to explore the musical scene  as far as possible within the constraints of trying to do a white-collar job in a factory on the Great West Road at the same time.<BR><BR>I was lucky enough to meet Linda Peters through her brother Brian that summer. We did a few floor spots in West London clubs which helped build up my confidence as a guitarist. But my main instrument was the flute which I wanted to use on the kind of interesting new songs that I was becoming aware of by listening to albums like Judy Collins </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>IN MY LIFE.</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><BR><BR>In September 1967, just as most of my friends were going to university, I took a number of related steps - I signed up at Chiswick Polytechnic for evening classes in jazz improvisation and arranging and I answered an ad in Musicians Wanted column of the <FONT SIZE=2>MELODY MAKER</FONT>. The band behind the ad was Tintagel, a student outfit based on Goldsmiths College in South East London (the college where John Cale studied music a few years earlier). Tintagel took two of us on board as a result of the ad - myself and Ian MacDonald who had just left the army. Ian went on to be a founder member of King Crimson and Foreigner. Ian and I both lived in West London and Ian had a minivan which suited me rather well saving me a two hour journey on the Greenline bus to get to rehearsals.<BR><BR>Tintagel specialised playing in versions of songs by West Coast bands - particularly Love (</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>DA CAPO</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> era), the Byrds and the Doors plus one or two Donovan tunes. One of the members had a Danelectro electric twelve string and also played sitar amplified through a bug. So with the flute, the band was able to make quite a convincing "flower-power" sound which meant it was regularly booked into the Middle Earth in Covent Garden. <BR><BR>Indeed exactly one week after auditioning with the band I found myself playing at the Middle Earth - on the same bill as an early version of Fairport Convention with Judy Dyble as lead singer. Richard Thompson's long guitar solo that night on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>RENO</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> made a big impression on me. It must have been the first time I heard a first class guitarist let rip with a Les Paul in a style which combined the blues and West Coast music.<BR><BR>Ian soon left Tintagel teaming up for a while with Judy Dyble after Sandy Denny took over in Fairport. Tintagel kept getting bookings at Middle Earth and so another ad went into the <FONT SIZE=2>MELODY MAKER</FONT> and a guitarist called Geoff joined - a trainee quantity surveyor from Brighton with lots of equipment.<BR><BR>Tintagel's big chance came when the sitarist met Dorris Henderson - an  American folksinger on the UK scene who had worked with John Renbourn. Dorris was on the bill for a folk concert at the Albert Hall together with Watersons, Al Stewart and Roy Harper in Spring 1968. I think she was looking for something to make her stand out and a six piece acid rock band seemed to fit the bill. I really enjoyed the Albert Hall and the review of our set in the <FONT SIZE=2>FINANCIAL TIMES</FONT> (which of course I have locked away) was quite favourable. I can remember our set included the Jackson C Frank song, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>MILK AND HONEY</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> which is also on Nick's </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>TANWORTH</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> tape. With Dorris and Tintagel I also got to play at Les Cousins and the Horsehoe.<BR><BR><BR><IMG Align=LEFT SRC="bilder/cambridge2.gif"><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=5>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>o by the time I got to Cambridge, I took myself rather seriously as a musician and spent the first term trying to find fellow-spirits. This wasn't that easy at first although on the same side of the quad of my College as my room there lived a rather mysterious medical student called Brian Wells who I eventually got to know through a certain third party. Then towards the end of the first term it all happened at once. A saxophonist and flute player from Islington, Steve Pheasant, suggested that he and I form a modal/free jazz quartet which we christened Horn. I also joined an acid rock band called White Unicorn which was based partly in Cambridge and partly in Wimbledon led by John Cole. (I was recently surprised to discover that John found Sandy Denny immediately after her tragic fall.)<IMG Align=LEFT SRC="bilder/horn.gif" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10"			VSPACE="10"><BR><BR>The key event, though, took place at the Cambridge Union that Winter. I can't remember who  else was on the bill for this concert but the first or second spot was taken by a student called Paul Wheeler who played acoustic guitar and sang his own songs. It was immediately obvious to me that he came from the "right" background musically - I soon discovered  that he had been hanging out with John Martyn before he came up to Cambridge. (It is curious how Paul, Nick and Robin Fredrick linked up at this time.) Anyway, I just loved Paul's music and so (very uncharacteristically) I went up to him in the interval in the Union bar and told him exactly what I thought of his set.<BR><BR>Paul suggested that I come round to his rooms for a blow. This went well and we soon became firm friends. I got to know his repertoire and  I just loved working with his tunes. They were linked to what I'd been playing and listening to before but were original and very evocative of certain moods. We played here and there, including, I think, a club in Amsterdam - we even got to blow at Cousins one night when John was on.<BR><BR>Two or three months later, one fine Spring afternoon, I went round to Paul's for a blow. This time there were rather more people hanging out than usual. Paul and I played a bit and then this rather quiet and very striking looking young man played some of his songs. One of these was </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>RIVER MAN</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> - which completely took my breath away. Readers may like to imagine what kind of impact this might have made, and all I can say is that you may well be right - it was extraordinary - the beauty, the invention, the meaning coming in and out of focus, the technical accomplishment, the timbres and sonorities.  It was as if I had finally found something which up until that point I had only come across various hints and suggestions might exist - for me, like hearing Judy Collins sing </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>SUZANNE</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> for the first time  or hearing Jeff Buckley or Television out of the blue.<BR><BR>I can't remember all the tunes Nick played but when I got hold of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>TIME OF NO REPLY</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> - about 7 years ago - and played it through for the first time I felt that I was hearing Nick do a lot of the material again - not the same experience as hearing the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>TANWORTH-IN-ARDEN</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> tape first time through a few months ago. The </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>TANWORTH</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> material is interesting to me because it indicates how far there was some sort of common musical agenda around amongst that generation of musicians but it is not the stuff that Nick was playing when I first met him.<BR><BR>One point I want to stress is that in those circumstances, although Nick was cool and somewhat aloof, he had no trouble in projecting himself and his work musically to the 8 or 10 people in the room. Those readers who have tried it will know that playing your own material to a small group of friends and family is not the easiest of audiences to work with - you are acutely aware of their reactions and it involves a lot of personal exposure. Speaking for myself, I would much rather play the Albert Hall. But Nick genuinely wasn't bothered - he just did his stuff. His music fitted in with other aspects of his presence - how he looked, how he spoke - his own charisma - and in my imagination at least, this literally filled the room.<BR><BR>I don't know whether any readers have heard the Davey Graham CD </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>(AFTER HOURS AT HULL UNIVERSITY)</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> which has just been released and was made in a student's bedroom in 1967 or 1968 - I can certainly recommend it. That recording, in my memory at least, has a similar ambience to that afternoon - warm and appreciative. The music is similar but by no means identical but it is the "vibe" that I am talking about.<BR><BR>Another important point is that Nick was very easy to get along with musically. I felt I could establish rapport with him,  fit in with what he was doing. He did give you something back when you played along with his music in those circumstances. The fact that it was Paul's place may have helped - Paul and Nick had a great deal in common in all sorts of ways - the were both English scholars with a similar way of looking at many issues.<BR><BR>The next episode that sticks out in my memory is the Caius May Ball. I had quite a good time that night - John Mayall topped the bill and  Horn, White Unicorn, Paul and Nick were all booked for the event.  Robert Kirby organized a set of Nick's songs with accompanying musicians, including Steve Pheasant and myself.  I am pretty sure that </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"MARY JANE"</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> was one of the songs that we played.  We  also played </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>MAYFAIR</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> as a duo and I remember the girl I took with me to the Ball saying that she hadn't enjoyed my playing on that one!  I have checked this recollection with her just this year, and all she can remember now is that there was a big argument between the musicians and the Ball organizers about what food we were going to get - whether it would be the same as those who had paid for their tickets. Such is life.<BR><BR><A HREF="meetingnickhumphries.html">(Recollections from Caius May Ball quoted from Patrick Humphries' biography)</A></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="mayball.html"><IMG SRC="bilder/mayballsmall2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="10"></A><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>After that Nick left Cambridge - at the end of his second year, the end of my first. That Summer, I was debating whether to follow his example. Graham Bond, a musician both Nick and I had liked in the mid-60's, was reforming a band, based in Cambridge,  which I auditioned for. We seemed to get on quite well but in the end I decided not to chance it and went off to the Edinburgh Festival for a gargantuan Steve Pheasant extravaganza called <FONT SIZE=2>STONY GROUND</FONT> (which also involved Paul and a neighbour of  mine Derek Ridgers who has become a highly regards rock photographer). Then we all pitched back into another academic year and a different set of musical projects.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="bilder/stonyground.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10"			VSPACE="10"><FONT SIZE=5>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> have to go back in time about six months now to explain the next step. At about the same time that I met Nick, White Unicorn played Wimbledon Town Hall on the same bill as Fairport Convention - they played first and we finished off the evening. We went down rather well with a local crowd and on the strength of this Fairport recommended us to Polydor. This led to some exploratory recording sessions.  I had rather enjoyed the experience and I wrote to Geoff, the guitarist from Tintagel, telling him about what it was like to go into the studio - how much easier it was over-dubbing the flute part than playing with a live rockband. These were the  days before PA's came with monitors and foldback. <BR><BR>In his reply, he invited me to come and meet a vocal harmony group he was working with called Design, who were based in Kensington. It was at Design's <BR>flat that I first met Alec Reid, a radio <BR>producer at BBC, who was taking an <BR>interest in this group.<BR><BR>In the Autumn of 1969 Alec started booking me for sessions with various folk artists for the late night show he produced for Radio 2.  It meant catching an early train from Cambridge, turning up at Broadcasting House in the morning and recording 8 songs in a day working with the artist and a session drummer and bass player - a busker's paradise which suited me quite well. I remember the bass player - a Welshman - who Alec often used and who also played with the Dudley Moore trio. This was all quite good fun, got me through a BBC audition, supplemented my grant and did something for my credibility on the student music scene. <IMG SRC="bilder/broadcast.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10"			VSPACE="10"><BR><BR>I got on well with Alec who has a very wide ranging and  discerning taste in music and the arts and at that time was writing poetry. I recommended </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> to Alec because I thought Nick's combination of talents should appeal to him. I was delighted when Alec booked Nick for Nightride and asked me to play on the session - no bass player or drummer.<BR><BR>To prepare for the session, I went to Nick's flat near Belsize Park tube station in Hampstead. (One little personal irony is that this flat is close to where I was married in November 1973). In many ways this was quite a sharp contrast to playing with him in Cambridge. This was at the time when Nick was working on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. When I heard this album I was surprised at the extent to which the music was unlike the material which I remembered working on in his flat.I have yet to locate a tape of the radio session and so at this point I am relying purely on my memory. <BR><BR><A HREF="hampstead.html">(Pictures from Hampstead)</A><BR><BR>My recollection is that Nick was working with a set of musical ideas thencurrent amongst people who wanted to push out the boundaries of song-writing. A good example would be the McCartney song from </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>THE WHITE ALBUM</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>, </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>MARTHA MY DEAR</FONT><FONT SIZE=3>. This may sound like another domestic Macca tune but in fact it is very artfully put together with bars of different lengths thrown in mainly to follow the logic of the tune rather than a standard 8 bar pattern. A similar thing happens in Bulgarian folk music and in the Grateful Dead's acoustic music. My recollection is that Nick was doing this, which made his newer material much more demanding to accompany. Having created these intricate patterns, Nick rightly wanted them followed precisely.<BR><BR>The music on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> is intricate in its way, but I have to say, armed with the preconceptions from working with him, I was disappointed in the second album and it has taken me over 25 years to get round to buying it. Possibly it is an album which works better as a CD than on vinyl - in my view the opposite is true of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> and also of some John Martyn albums of that period.<BR><BR>The playing on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>PINK MOON</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> which most equates to my memory is the syncopation on </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>ROAD</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> in the motif which the guitar plays between verses which uses both half note offsets to the pulse and also crotchet triplets. It is easy to blur the difference between these two although they are not the same in terms of how the rhythm is presented to the listener.  This is the kind of thing that Nick could be very precise about.<A HREF="pawnpoems.html"><IMG SRC="bilder/pawn1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10"			VSPACE="10"></A><BR><BR>I have to say that I may have remembered all this wrong -  several Cambridge songwriters became interested in these issues over the next year - especially Richard Jones who had played bass with Climax Chicago Blues Band before going up to read English at the same time as me. <A HREF="frith.html">Fred Frith</A>, who has since become a major pioneer in guitar music and who began to read English at the same time as Nick was another person who developed the Jansch/Renbourn guitar techniques in very unusual directions in the songs he wrote. I remember particularly the one which started "what you lose is a pair of shoes to put your mind in". I think Fred was amongst the first to push ahead in this way but I have yet to talk to him on the subject of Nick. (Richard, <BR>Fred and I had a little venture going <BR>at one stage, named after a cat.)<BR><BR>I didn't see Nick after I left Cambridge. Indeed I only met up with Paul again in 1975. In November 1974 I was in Edinburgh and I think somehow the news of Nick's death filtered through as a shock but not a surprise. I came across </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>PINK MOON</FONT><FONT SIZE=3> in a record shop shortly afterwards in Islington.  I bought it without even bothering to hear it. It was clear enough from the cover what it would be about and the songs and their treatments were immediately accessible.<BR><BR>In 1975, I met Paul again. I was separated from my wife and he had a raft of wonderful new songs which we have been working on here and there over the years. One in particular starts:<BR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>        "Waking up to confusion, it's so hard to start the day<BR>        But you couldn't stop it coming, there must be fusion on the way"</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><BR><BR>When you read the story of Nick's last three years there is a temptation to think - oh if only I'd been in touch I am sure I could have made a difference. Knowing some of the people who were closer and their assessment of how things were, I conclude this is an understable misapprehension, but a misapprehension nonetheless.<BR><BR> <FONT SIZE=2>&copy; &nbsp; I A I N &nbsp; C A M E R O N &nbsp; O C T O B E R &nbsp; 1 9 9 8<BR><BR><HR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><BR>Iain lives in Surrey and works in London.
