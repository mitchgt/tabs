The evening will include many of Drake's songs performed by a roster of artists who he influenced or who've become fans of his music, including Vancouver's Veda Hille and Kevin Kane, Robin Holcomb and Ian Moore from Seattle, Kathleen Yearwood, Herald Nix, Kate Hammett-Vaughan, Daniel Lapp, Tony Wilson, Peggy Lee, Chris Gestrin, Time Waits, Mark Szabo, Carl Newman, Daniel Bejar, Julie Vik, Mark Spybey, Alexander Varty, and other performers. Some will also be presenting their own songs in Drake's honour.<BR><BR>Nick Drake died tragically young 25 years ago this November. Barely known or appreciated during his lifetime, he's been recognized in recent years as one of the major figures in British music of the late 60s and early 70s. His songs, nominally linked to the folk-rock movement, resist stylistic categorization. Poetic, ambiguous, inward, and deeply felt, they continue to resonate with a sweet, melancholy power that seems timeless. <BR><BR>Many artists have recorded cover versions - Lucinda Williams, Duncan Sheik, Kelly Willis, Sebadoh, Swans, Brad Mehldau, Andy Bey, Christine Collister, Norma Waterson, and Alexis Korner among others - sometimes radically recontexting his songs, sometimes sticking closely to the originals. In this concert we'll be taking an eclectic approach. Nick's music ranges across folk, pop, classical, jazz, bossa nova, and other styles, and the artists will be bringing their own sensibility and arrangements to the material. There will be solo singers and groups, and a number of vocal and instrumental collaborations are also planned. <BR><BR>Tickets are $15 and $13 (students/seniors) and are available from Ticketmaster, Black Swan, Zulu and Highlife.<BR><BR>The concert is being co-sponsored by the CBC and the Georgia Straight.<BR><BR>For more information contact Tony Reif (Songlines Recordings) at 737-1632 or Alexander Varty at the Georgia Straight, 730-7000.<BR><BR><BR><BR>	</TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
