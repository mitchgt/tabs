Ever since I read Arthur Lubow's essay (that came with the <FONT SIZE=2>FRUIT TREE</FONT> box set) more than ten years ago, I have been aware of Paul Wheeler's connection to Nick and the Cambridge circuit, and I knew that it was he who brought Nick and John Martyn together, but I hadn't had the pleasure of hearing any of his music until just a few months ago. <FONT SIZE=2>RAIN OVER THE ISLAND</FONT> is Paul's first proper album release, and it's a summary of 30 years of song-writing. It includes songs that Nick heard before he made his first album, and it includes a song that has been covered by John Martyn. This page is an introduction to his works.<BR><BR>Mikael Ledin, January 1999</FONT><FONT SIZE=3 color="770000"><BR><BR><BR>UPDATE, September 2001: <BR><BR>Paul Wheeler's new album, <FONT SIZE=3 color="#990000"><A HREF="PWcd2.html">Seachanges</A></FONT><P><BR><HR><BR> <FONT SIZE=3 color="#990000"><A HREF="PWintro.html">Introduction</A> | <A HREF="PWinterview.html">Interview</A> | <A HREF="PWcd.html">CD Info</A> | <A HREF="PWreview.html">CD Review</A></FONT></CENTER><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><FONT SIZE="1"> Compiled by Mikael Ledin (text + content) and Mats Renvall (graphics)<BR>			Thanks to: Erik Regnstr&#246;m</FONT></TD>	</TR></TD></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
