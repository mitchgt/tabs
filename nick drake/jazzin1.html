Its inspiration and impact stretch far and wide - <FONT SIZE=2>MOJO</FONT> haveeven established that it may have been an element in the formation ofthelate 60s revitalisation of  soul by James Brown - not a musical genre which atfirst sight shares the aesthetic values summarised so succintly here.<BR><BR>The first track on the album - <FONT SIZE=2>SO WHAT</FONT> - is very much the archetypal tune - itembodies most of the technical innovations which make <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> so important,especially:<BR><BR>a) the use of scales rather than chords as the basis of improvisation<BR><BR>b) a simple decsending riff with deceptive harmony as a primary motif<BR><BR>c) the use of a semitone shift in the middle section to create a  change ofperspective<BR><BR>d) displacing simple triadic harmony by the addition of a "foreign" note  to themiddle of the chord thereby introducing  fourths and seconds into the harmony toadd bite and strength<BR><BR>e) within Miles Davis' solo, a floating dissociated sense, enhanced my Miles'habit of starting phrases half way through the bar<BR><BR>The use of sidesteps (tone or halftone)  as part of the harmonic structure ofsongs has been identified by Dr Andrew Keeling as a distinctive feature of Nick'swork in his series of articles in the magazine <FONT SIZE=2>PINK MOON</FONT>. Robin Frederick haswritten in <FONT SIZE=2>MOJO</FONT> about Nick's unusual use of harmony and about his strange way ofstarting songs part way through a bar.<BR><BR>So on this basis, it looks as if part of what made Nick distinctive came intohismusic via his well documented interest in jazz as a teenager.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="bilder/miles.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH=170 HEIGHT=180><P><BR></FONT><A NAME="2"><FONT SIZE=5 color="#990000">ARCHETYPAL IMPROVISATION</FONT><BR><BR>Nick, quite famously, did not improvise in the studio. He arrived with songsfully worked out and always played guitar parts identically. Paul Wheeler  hasconfirmed that at Cambridge and  subsequently this was typical of Nick inplayinghis work to others. <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> is the complete antithesis of this approach -noone except Miles and possibly the piano player Bill Evans knew what form themusic of <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> was going to take when they turned up for the date.Nonetheless the record is made up entirely of first takes - it is the essence ofthe spontaneous creativity which lies at the heart of jazz.<BR><BR>Bill Evans' account has become famous:  <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We really just went in that day and didour thing. Miles conceived <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of those settings only hours before the recordingdates and arrived with <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sketches which indicated to the group what was to beplayed. Therefore <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you hear something close to pure spontaneity in theseperformances. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The group never played  these pieces prior to the recordings and I <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;think without exception the first performance of each was a take. /.../ <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wenever had a rehearsal. Everything was done on the job".</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><BR><BR>So <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> shares with Nick's work an aesthetic tone or mood, some harmonicand structural devices but not an approach to managing creativity.<BR><BR>There is one more rather strange parallel I want to point out between <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> and Nick's work. In his autobiography, Miles explains that <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> wasonly a qualified success from his point of view. Miles had heard some Africanfinger piano music prior to the recording - this is indeed modal - and hadwantedto bring into the musical conceptions more of the atmosphere of this genre. Hefelt he had not succeeded in this.<BR><BR>The irony is that in taking <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> as an aesthetic formal and harmonicmodel and then adding folk derived finger style guitar instrumentation Nick mayhave been moving closer to Miles' original aspiration.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="25"><FONT SIZE=5 color="#990000">GIANT STEPS</FONT><BR><BR>One of the soloists on <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> was the tenor saxophonist, John Coltrane,andabout a month after completing the second of the two <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> sessions in the Spring of1959 he began the sessions which would go to make up the album <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT>.Thisrecord would, like <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT>, help mark a period of transition in jazz andwould extend John Coltrane's reputation as a major voice in the genre. <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT> was a record Nick listened to a lot at Marlborough.<BR><BR>John Coltrane used Miles Davis' approach to managing creativity - introducinghisconceptions to the musicians in the studio. Indeed Miles in his autobiography isjustifiably proud that Coltrane had adopted his way of making records.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="3"><FONT SIZE=5 color="#990000">DOMINANT TENSION</FONT><BR><BR>To tell the story further we need to look a little into the theory of music.Muchjazz uses harmonic improvisation - the harmony is what keeps the musicianstogether and makes sure all their contributions gel. To secure forwardpropulsionin time, harmonic progression - tension and relaxation are important structuralelements. A dominant chord is one which naturally leads to its successor (thetonic) with a sense of tension and resolution.<BR><BR>The way in which this tension and relaxation is expressed is one of the definingfeatures of a period or school of jazz. In particular, Charlie Parker as aleaderof the be-bop revolution in the mid 1940s expanded the harmonic language ofdominant/tonic relationships. Miles Davis played with Parker as a teenager andfully understood what was going on. <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> is important (amongst otherreasons) for completely abandoning/simplifying these key harmonic relationships-and it is in that sense that the album is seen as marking the end of the be-bopera.<BR><BR>One of the musicians who did as much as anyone to define the post be-bop era wasJohn Coltrane and in that sense <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT> is transitional - it is almost areduction ad absurdum of be-bop. If be-bop is hard to play then then the fasttunes on <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT> are impossible.<BR><BR>Chains of dominant/tonic harmonic resolution (using the cycle of fifths) arecommon in jazz. One such tune would be <FONT SIZE=2>SWEET GEORGIA BROWN</FONT> where such a chaindefines the first 16 bars. Another common location for such a chain would be inthe middle eight (B section) of so-called rhythm changes. These changes (basedon<FONT SIZE=2>I GOT RHYTHM</FONT>) are the basis of a number of be-bop tunes and swing tunes - swingpreceded be-bop which evolved out of it. The middle eight changes to the rhythmchangesare:<BR><BR>       D7  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    G7  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  C7    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F7  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   (2 bars each - the tune being "in" Bb)<BR><BR>Besides elaborating chords, be-bop introduced a technique of substituting chords- taking a simple chord or chords and replacing them with more complicatedharmonically challenging changes.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT> famously takes this substitution technique a stage further - anddefines what has become known as Coltrane Substitutions. The source of thesesubstitutions is a 32 bar Broadway song - <FONT SIZE=2>HAVE YOU MET MISS JONES</FONT>. The middle 8(B section) of this song takes giant steps through the harmonic spectrum - thechanges are:<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="bilder/jazzinchords.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH=248 HEIGHT=47><p>Coltrane  used this method of harmonic progression in the title tune of <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT> and also on the blitzkrieg track - <FONT SIZE=2>COUNTDOWN</FONT>.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="4"><FONT SIZE=5 color="#990000">A LITTLE JAZZ HISTORY</FONT><BR><BR>Before looking further at <FONT SIZE=2>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT> we need to examine jazz history a little further,especially the cluster of musicians who marked the transition from the 1950s tothe 1960s<BR><BR>The Miles Davis Sextet recorded  <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> on 2 March and 22 April 1959.There is a film clip from a TV show - the Robert Herridge Theatre Show, a localTV arts programme made at the time in which Coltrane and Davis play <FONT SIZE=2>SO WHAT</FONT> from<FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT>. This is a fundamental document in the history of 20th centurymusicand I would encourage any reader to see it. As Jack Chambers observes - Coltraneplays magnificently and sounds like the way he was to play a few years laterwhenhe was with his quartet and at the height of his powers. It is rare for theMilesDavis group to take a newly recorded work so quickly into its repertoire.<BR><BR>In the TV recording  Coltrane improvises a line which he subsequently took intoone of his own later landmark compositions - <FONT SIZE=2>IMPRESSIONS</FONT>. So the recordingprobably captures a moment of composition.<BR><BR>Two weeks after the second <FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> session - on 4 and 5 May 1959 - Coltranestarted work on <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT>. Besides <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT> itself there is one ballad on the album- <FONT SIZE=2>NAIMA</FONT> - dedicated to Coltrane's wife.  This tune stayed in his repertoire forthe rest of his career although it underwent various changes. It included anumber of interesting Drake-like features:<BR><BR>- long sustained notes played vibratoless in the melody<BR>- long sustained notes in the bass - termed "pedals"<BR>- complex harmonies - minor sevenths sustained over   a pedal which isn't completely "right" in conventional terms<BR>- major minor ambiguities<BR>- a middle 8 which derived its harmonic mysteriousness  by moving into flatter keys<BR><BR>After <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT> Coltrane recorded an album with Don Cherry (father of Neneh).Don Cherry was a key member of Ornette Coleman's quartet along with BillyHiggins. Then a few months later, Coltrane assembled his own Quartet - the ensemblewhichcemented his reputation as one of the two or three greatest musicians in thehistory of jazz and which had an enormous effect on all kinds of music andmusicians in the 1960s.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="5"><FONT SIZE=5 color="#990000">THE GREAT QUARTET</FONT><BR><BR>The quartet featured McCoy Tyner on piano and Elvin Jones on drums. They wentinto the studio at the end of 1960 to produce an amazingly successful record - <FONT SIZE=2>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</FONT> - a tune in 3:4 time and a minor key. <BR><BR>The story of this tune is well told in the Independent compilation - <FONT SIZE=2>THE LIVES OF GREAT SONGS</FONT>. It is important to recognise that Trane picked up this tunefrom<FONT SIZE=2>THE SOUND OF MUSIC</FONT> before it was recorded by anyone else and well before the hitfilm was made. He played it on soprano saxophone and thereby introduced a newsound and aesthetic into jazz - virtually defining the decade's interest inEastern sources of music.<BR><BR>As this series of essays unfolds, we will skirt round the edge of a debate aboutthe aesthetic validity of jazz - a debate which is based on the views of  theprofound insights of the philosopher and critic Theodor Adorno.<FONT SIZE=2>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</FONT> has become a totem in this debate - as an example of howjazzcan transform aesthetic kitsch into genuine art. In his paper <FONT SIZE=2>ADORNO AND JAZZ:REFLECTIONS ON A FAILED ENCOUNTER</FONT> Schonherr writes:<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Within a period of six years he [Coltrane] freed this tune from all <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;functional harmonic and metric simplicity. The contrast to the original <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shows most radically in the recording from 1966, within which the <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;deconstructed thematic material only resurfaces fragmentarily through <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;largely atonal improvisations. The treatment of this piece documents <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;beyond the biographical implications also a musical self-reflection <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the history of jazz and its aesthetic procedures which converge in <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the 1960s to a large extent with those of contemporary music."</FONT><BR><BR>I would like to speculate just a little on Nick's reaction to the creativetrajectory which Schonherr, correctly in my view, identifies in Coltrane. It is myopinion that Nick was absorbed by Coltrane's aesthetic project as it emerged in<FONT SIZE=2>KIND OF BLUE</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=2>GIANT STEPS</FONT>. I strongly suspect - especially in the light of my ownexperience and how it lined up with that of teenagers across the Westernworldin the first half of the sixties - that he stayed with the project as it wascarried forward by the great Coltrane quartet. I think he may have stoppedfollowing it at Marlborough as it moved into its more atonal post quartet phases.There is a particular fragment in the biography which suggests this to me. I amstill working on the question of whether Nick came back to it. Paul Wheeler hassuggested to me a mutual friend of his and Nick's who may be able to throw lighton this and related points.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="bilder/coltrane.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=207><P><BR><A NAME="6"><FONT SIZE=5 color="#990000">UNDER THE INFLUENCE</FONT><BR><BR>This group - the Coltrane Quartet - and this tune - <FONT SIZE=2>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</FONT> - wereextraordinarily influential within and beyond jazz:<BR><BR>a) the new generation of musicians, particularly on the West Coast, took theColtrane group to their hearts. David Crosby went to hear the quartet play liveand concluded that they were taking acoustic jazz to the limit - the only placeto go after that was electric music. Roger McGuinn emulated Trane on theintroduction to <FONT SIZE=2>EIGHT MILES HIGH</FONT>;<BR><BR>b) members of the Jefferson Airplane were fans of the quartet; John Densmore,drummer with the Doors, went to hear the quartet and was utterly entranced.Coltrane immediately became a culture hero for John and his pals. Earlyobserversof the Doors saw them as playing a unique blend of blues, rock and jazz with thejazz element especially coming in through the drumming;<BR><BR>c)  when Jimmy Hendrix first heard the Coltrane Quartet on record he turned toMitch Mitchell and remarked how the drummer on the record sounded like theExperience drummer. Mitch Mitchell had of course studied Elvin Jones'polyrhythmic innovations and correctly assessed that the structure of theExperience - based on a towering innovative improvisational genius - required asimilar approach to that used by the Coltrane Quartet - rock solid bass andintense interaction between the solo voice and percussion<BR><BR>d) the leading classical flute player of the 60s - Rampal - heard <FONT SIZE=2>MY FAVOURITE THINGS</FONT> and immediately became a Coltrane devotee<BR><BR>e) all the emerging innovators of the US school of Minimalist composition -La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Philip Glass and John Adams arerecordedas having been fans of the Coltrane Quartet and most went to see the quartetseveral times.  Indeed John Adams - now the most played living US composer -speaks of preferring to listen to Coltrane rather  than analyse Webern's tonerows in line with his academic studies<BR><BR>f) another literate teenager - Patti Smith - describes her experience as follows:<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "In 1963 I got Coltrane's My Favourite Things. I tried to hang out at jazz clubs<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;like the Showboat just to see the musicians but I was way to young though once I <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;made it to Pep's to see Coltrane for a few minutes before I got thrown out. You had<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to be eighteen so these people helped me to get dressed up trying to look older.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was basically a pigtails and sweatshirt kind of kid. So I got in for fifteen<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;minutes and then they carded me and kicked me out. He did "Nature Boy". I was in<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;such heaven seeing them, Elvin Jones and McCoy Tyner that I wasn't even disturbed<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that I got thrown out /.../ As a teenager I also imagined myself as a jazz poet -<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;not a very good one. I'd just listen to Coltrane and then write poetry."</FONT><BR><BR><BR><B>A Personal Note</B><BR><BR>I hope readers will forgive me for adding a personal note. I still rememberhearing the impact of Coltrane's sheets of sound technique - on <FONT SIZE=2>TWO BASS HIT</FONT>, on a Fontana EP - as a teenager. It cost 13 shillings and six pence. It definedtheway forward. I would sit reading John Robinson's <FONT SIZE=2>HONEST TO GOD</FONT> listening to <FONT SIZE=2>A LOVE SUPREME</FONT> wondering whether I could in all validity continue to be a Sundayschool teacher. At the end of my year out I was made redundant and used theseverance package to buy a soprano - when I met Steve Pheasant and we formedHornwe tried the experiment of two sopranos doing Trane style modal improvisation.In my Moral Sciences Part II Tripos - in the Ethics and Aesthetics paper - therewas a question about revolutionary works of art. I wrote for an hour on <FONT SIZE=2>A LOVE SUPREME</FONT> - and passed. What other kind of answer can they have been expecting?<BR><BR>In the early 70s I went to Ronnie Scott's and sat in the front row to hear Elvin Jones,Trane'sdrummer, play. It felt to me as if he was reorganising my conception of rhythmandtime-keeping - on the molecular level.<BR><BR>Finally, it is worth noting that in his autobiography John Cale talks about drawing inspiration from Coltrane's playing in the late 1950s prior to the formation of the great quartet - while Trane was still working with Miles.</FONT></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="links"><A HREF="jazzin2.html"><FONT SIZE=2>JAZZIN WITH NICK, PAGE 2</FONT></A></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE><HR NOSHADE> <FONT SIZE=1>Compiled by Mikael Ledin</TD></TR></TABLE</BODY></HTML>
