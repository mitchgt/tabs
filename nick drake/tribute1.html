I was there, and I guess mostly I wantedto say how unique and wonderful I felt this event was. The entireprogram was Nick Drake covers or interpretations, and each performerwas, in their own way, just superb. [Everyone was at the very leastcompetent, and more than that.] Probably the thing that touched me themost were the shy, talented and beautiful young men who performed.  Acouple of them were really nervous, and it made me think of Nickhimself, 25 or 30 years ago...<BR><BR>But there really was a range of approaches.  There were some excellent pretty straight covers; some interpretations (which Ialways find intriguing, and in this case liked a lot); and therewas some orchestration performed by an ensemble. <BR><BR>The evening was set in an amazing venue; an old converted barn, inparkland.  The barn itself was the performance hall, and it issurrounded by a modern conservatory that is filled with art items.  Fabrics and metal, suspended from the ceiling.  Benches, with quotesfrom Shakespeare on them.  Paintings on the walls. A perfect placeto be.<BR><BR>The show was not one of slick professionalism and glossy performance.I dont think that was the intention anyway. It was unique in having amix of 'known' and 'unknown' performers, who had in common a love ofNick Drake's music, and I suppose the professionalism came in the factthat each one of them gave us (the packed audience) the gift of songsfrom the heart --- their own hearts; honesty and beauty (and somebeautiful music). Everyone had their own connection to Nick; therewere people who had known him, and there were people who had found hismusic only recently.  One of the performers had not heard of him untilhe was asked to do this tribute; he said that he had been given atape, and as soon as he put it on he was hooked.  There were funnystories, and there were sad stories.  Felix Johansen came from Norway toperform, and he said that until recently, he had only had access tothe music, really didnt know much about Nick at all.  He said 'I didnteven know he was dead; I just thought he lived in England'.<BR><BR>I don't really want to say too much about the individual acts; I think myown experience of them is a very personal one --- I might like thingsthat others don't, and vice versa --- and as always, my response toNick Drake's music is emotional. I was overwhelmed. Everyone whoperformed contributed something special to the event; for me, personally,the ones that stood out were these:<BR><BR><FONT COLOR="#880000">Christian Laverick</FONT> --- who did his own take on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">FRUIT TREE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> (which wasspectacular) and also </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">ROAD</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">.  Very original.<BR><FONT COLOR="#880000">Steve Britner</FONT> --- a perfect cover of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">HAZEY JANE I</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"><BR><FONT COLOR="##880000">Mark Thomas</FONT> --- also a brilliant cover, of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">SATURDAY SUN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">(both of these performers have voices that go right through you).<BR><FONT COLOR="##880000">Iain Cameron</FONT> --- a jazzish improvisational take (flute) on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">CLOTHES OF SAND</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, with bits of some other stuff threaded through it.<BR><FONT COLOR="##880000">Dave Gardner</FONT> --- who appeared as a kind of 'new romantic' (an erain music that I managed to miss out on completely) with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">THINGS BEHIND THE SUN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"><BR><FONT COLOR="##880000">Andrew Keeling & Iain Cameron</FONT> --- a flute duet on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">HORN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, including someimprovisation, which was superb and chilling<BR><FONT COLOR="##880000">Ian Beaver</FONT> --- ended the evening, another lovely young voice, with</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">WAY TO BLUE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, with the Speranza String Quartet.  I think this was theperfect choice for the last piece... <BR><BR>This tribute was organised by Steve Wilcock (who also performed --- acover of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">BLACK EYED DOG</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, which was very moving); thank you Steve forimagining this event, and all the people who got up there and madethis an evening I would not have missed for the world. On the waythere, I thought 'I must be nuts, schlepping across half of Britain tohear some music'. Now I know I would have been nuts not to.<BR><BR><HR NO SHADE><BR><B>THE COMPLETE SETLIST</B><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">FIRST HALF (All acoustic guitar + vox except where indicated)<BR><BR>Tony Robinson - River Man<BR>Chris Healey - Three Hours, Free Ride<BR>Christian Laverick - Fruit Tree, Road<BR>Steve Britner - Hazey Jane I (+ mandolin)<BR>Steve Wilcock - Black Eyed Dog (+ slide guitar)<BR>Nick Clarry - Place To Be, Harvest Breed, Fly (+ viola)<BR>Iain Cameron - Clothes Of Sand (Flute instrumental)<BR>Bob Pritchard - Which Will, From The Morning<BR>Ian Hodgson & John Wade - Pink Moon (+ piano for solo)<BR>Mark Thomas - Saturday Sun (+ piano, bass, drums, vibes)<BR><BR><BR>SECOND HALF<BR><BR>Dave Gardner - Northern Sky (+piano) Things Behind The Sun (+violin)<BR>Alain Gratton - Hanging On A Star, Voice From A Mountain<BR>Michael Chapman - Which Will, Time Has Told Me (both +pedal steel)<BR>Felix Johansen - Clothes Of Sand, Joey<BR>Andrew Keeling & Iain Cameron - Horn (flute duet)<BR>Andrew Keeling * - Time of No Reply<BR>Ken Nicol * - Thoughts Of Mary Jane, Cello Song<BR>Ian Beaver * - Way To Blue<BR><BR>* = Speranza String Quartet with Iain Cameron on flute on Time Of No Reply and Thoughts Of Mary Jane,and Harold Dearden on congas on Cello Song<BR><BR>Editor's note: Patsy Matheson, who was mistakenly listed on the announcement page as one of the acts, had never agreed to perform at this concert. <BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2"><BR><A HREF="NDnews.html">Back to the News page</A>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td height="124" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> <div align="center"><A HREF="DRAKE.html"><img src="bilder/NDfri.GIF" vspace="5" border="0"></A></div></SPAN> </td>    </tr>  </table></TD></TR></TABLE></div></body></html>
