The producers of the film are organizing a series of 'NickDrake evenings' in a few big cities, starting in Amsterdam. They alsoaim to screen the film at coming international festivals and there areplans to release and distribute the film in the near future in such away that everybody sooner or later will be able to have access to it.Watch these pages for further information.<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><B>August, 1999</B><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 color="#990000"><B>A Skin Too Few - the days of Nick Drake</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3> is a 50 minutes documentary,shot on film and due to come out in projection on internationalfilm festivals and broadcasts by various TV-networks from the end of thisyear on.<BR> &nbsp; People involved are; Gabrielle Drake, Joe Boyd, John Wood, Robert Kirby,Brian Wells, Keith Morris and Paul Weller.<BR> &nbsp; It's telling the story of Nick's life in almost chapterlike episodes,starting from early childhood in Burma, mingled with atmospheric imagesof each period. <BR> &nbsp; But surely the most important factor is the music,accompanied by dramatic images of the landscapes in and around Tanworth,Cambridge and London. Nick's abandoned Far Leys' room, and most of hisoriginal belongings (!) in it, stands out in the film during all seasonsand times as a silent witness. <BR> &nbsp; With the original (!) 8-track of <FONT SIZE=2>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT> John Wood and Robert Kirby are able to demonstrate, byseparating the tracks, how a Nick Drake song is built up. <BR> &nbsp; The story isof course inevitably sad, but the film tries to go beyond it, alsobecause we'll see for the first time the long hoped for super-8 footageof a very, very young and lively moving Nick and his family!<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; - Jeroen Berkvens<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>	</TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
