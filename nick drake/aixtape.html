Before you begin to send e-mails: No, I don't own a copy of this tape and no, I don't know anyone who does - in fact, I find it unlikely that the rest of us will ever hear it unless Joe Boyd and Gabrielle Drake one day decide to release more Nick Drake material from the vaults officially.</B></FONT><BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=5>NICK DRAKE TAPE FIND </FONT><BR>from Record Collector Magazine<BR><BR><BR>Late last year, after thepublication of his biography of Nick Drake, author Patrick Humphriesreceived a letter from someone who claimed to have a tape of thesinger-songwriter in France in early 1967.<BR><BR>"Initially, I was very wary," Humphries says, "but I went to hear thetape, expecting to be disappointed.<BR><BR>"Even when I saw the tape, I still expected the worst. This was anamateur recording on a standard C90 cassette which, by then, had beenknocking around for more than 30 years. But when I finally heard it, Iwas just stunned. Apart from the amazing clarity of the recording,there was a real quality of intimacy to the performance. Given thatNick had only been out of school for six months, he already soundedastonishingly confident and assured. It was completely at odds withthis image of Nick Drake as the permanently bruised and batteredoutsider."<BR><BR>Familiar with the poor quality bootleg of Nick's Tanworth home demoswhich were recorded later in 1967, Humphries was expecting something ofa similar standard: "But the quality of the Aix tape was soextraordinarily clear that it was really quite eerie.<BR><BR>"This chap had one of the earliest Philips portable recorders, which hehad taken down to France so he could listen to tapes of The Beatles andStones. Apparently Nick was curious to hear how his voice would soundon tape, and asked if he could be recorded. The guy who made therecording reckoned that the quality was so good because the apartmenthad one of those French stone floors, which provided near perfectacoustics."<BR><BR>The tape was recorded in Aix-en-Provence, some time during February orMarch 1967, a good two-and-a-half years before Drake's official Islanddebut <italic>Five Leaves Left</italic>, not released until September1969. Drake had gone down to the South of France, ostensibly to improvehis language skills, though according to a number of friends inHumphries' book most of his time was spent drinking cheap red wine,smoking Disques Bleus and developing his guitar technique. It waswhilst in France that Drake wrote his first original song, "Princess OfThe Sand" <FONT SIZE=2>[also known as "Strange Meeting II", ed. note]</FONT>, which is among the numbers he performs on the newlydiscovered tape.<BR><BR>All the other songs are covers, among them Bob Dylan's "Tomorrow Is ALong Time", Bert Jansch's "Strolling Down The Highway", and TheYoungbloods' "Get Together". Evidently one of the few who bought a copyof Jackson C. Frank's eponymous album in 1965, Nick also chose torecord three songs by the American singer-songwriter: "Here Come TheBlues", "Milk & Honey", and "Kimbie".<BR><BR>"What is so fascinating about the Aix tape," Humphries explains, "isthat it offers an opportunity to hear Nick Drake at the very beginning.To my surprise, the 35-minute tape was very much a completeperformance, interspersed with Drake's own comments on the songs. Buthe sounds completely relaxed, quietly confident. He plays, he sings, heeven laughs!"<BR><BR>The last ten minutes or so of the tape are much less clear, and wereobviously recorded on a different occasion. But Humphries believes thateven these fragments have a certain fly-on-the-wall charm: "Thebackground noise suggests a party, and Nick - probably fuelled by vinordinaire - can be heard playing to a boisterous crowd. Of course, it'snot John Lennon at the Woolton Village Fete, but it is a pricelesssnapshot which I'm sure Nick's fans would love the opportunity to hear.And in the light of what happened to him later, it's just so nice tohear the young Nick sounding relaxed and happy, and so full of hope forthe future."<BR><BR></BODY></HTML></BLOCKQUOTE><HR NOSHADE><FONT SIZE=1> Compiled by Mikael Ledin (text + content) and Mats Renvall (graphics)<br> Thanks to: Erik Regnstr&ouml;m</body></html>
