Considine.<BR><BR><BR></CENTER><i>by Robin Frederick</i><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="txt">         In an article in Guitar World </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">ACOUSTIC</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> magazine (Summer 2000 issue) critic J.D.Considine writes that Nick Drake's current popularity is attributable totwo things - the allure of his tragic life and his intricately-pickedrhythm guitar. He dismisses Drake's songs with comments like "insubstantialmelody," "lovesick lyrics," and "tuneful mutterings." He suggests they aretoo oblique, somehow not quite obvious enough to suit our nineties tastesas if, in and of itself, suggestion rather than direct statement is somehowsuspect. As a professional songwriter, I feel it's important to point outthat J.D. Considine is right... and wrong. There is indeed a great dealgoing on in these songs that is not immediately apparent. A truly reservedEnglishman, Nick Drake hid his talent discreetly behind a subtlesimplicity. Only when you take the time to look beneath the surface do youdiscover Drake's amazing facility with chord progressions, meter, phrasing,major/minor key changes, and diffident homages to the jazz greats of thetime.<br><br>But let's look for a moment at the notion that people are attracted to NickDrake's music because of his tragic life. I would say that based on hisrecent surge in popularity, this cannot be true. Those people who firstheard his music as part of a Volkswagen Cabrio commercial surely did notknow who he was or what became of him. Still, there must have beensomething about the voice, the melody, the chords, the lyrics... somethingthat made them flood the VW website looking for the name of the artist.They did not know anything about his life when they arrived at Amazon.comto buy the album, driving sales of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">PINK MOON</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> into the Top 5, brieflyoutstripping even 'N Sync's sales. At this point, yes, they probably readthe bio and looked at the photos. Yes, there is a tragic story there and,yes, there is a handsome young man who will never grow old or bald orpaunchy. However there are, unfortunately, a lot of dead musicians who ledtragic lives; generally people don't run out and buy their albums.<br><br>As for the songs themselves, as I've said elsewhere, to think that what'simportant about Nick Drake is his dark romanticism is like thinking what'simportant about Brian Wilson is surfing. It's missing the point.<br><br>I'd like to give an example that will demonstrate both Drake's abilities asa songwriter and show that what Considine considers a weakness -- "hisrecordings rely more on atmosphere and mood than on melody" -- is reallysomething quite different.  Drake's melodies are often woven in and out ofhis chord progressions, adding extensions (major 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths) tothe chords.  River Man is an excellent example. This is a four-chord songwith a simple repeating melody, so why is it so haunting? Why does a highlyrespected music critic like Ian MacDonald call it "one of the sky-highclassics of post-war English popular music"?<br><br>River Man's verse is a series of two-bar phrases: each chord is held fortwo bars, each two-bar melodic phrase begins in the middle of a two-barchord phrase (a favorite trick of Nick's). As he changes chords, hesustains the melody line through the change, the melody line then becomesthe extension of the following chord. All of this is done in 5/4 time, ameter that sounds as if it is "spilling over" into the next measure.Delivered with a steady, easy confidence, it results in a riverine sense offlowing motion, wave lapping upon wave, literally creating a river ofsound, a River Man's world. This songwriting device (the use of music tounderscore lyric content) is called "prosody" and few songwriters evermaster it. Among Nick's compositions, it appears over and over again in oneform or another. Nick Drake was not using melody to create pop hooks -- itisn't easy to hum most of Nick's songs -- he was using melody to createexactly what J.D. Considine says he was: mood and atmosphere.<br><br>Considine is right, of course, about Nick's mastery of the guitar, but hisfancy fingerpicking was not "the salvation of many a tune on his albums."The songs themselves stand as testimony to his astonishing talent. Thereare certainly people who may not like all his songs, or may not like<i>any</i> of them, but from the point of view of a working songwriter,Drake's three albums are a master class in songwriting craft andvariations.<br><br>As for Considine's assertion that "traces of heroin were found in his[Nick's] body," it is a totally unsubstantiated rumor. As a professionaljournalist, Considine knows this statement should be clearly labeled ashearsay. By failing to do so, he himself is furthering the myth of the"tragic life" he is so quick to deplore.<br><br>The question remains: "Why would his music strike a chord now?"  Considineasks it as do many others who have written about Drake's life and music. Isit simply because people are hearing it for the first time? If theVolkswagen Cabrio ad had aired ten years ago would people have reacted asthey are reacting now? It is true that, as Considine points out, "We popfans do love our tragic heroes." Nick Drake certainly evokes that image,but the tragedy and heroism are not revealed through his life, they arerevealed through his songs. They are present in the ability and courage toexpress deep emotional truths: vulnerability, hope, yearning, self-hatred,and despair. We have few acceptable ways of expressing these difficultfeelings and it is perhaps not coincidental that we live in a culture rifewith misplaced rage and alienation. So, yes, there may be a reason why NickDrake is coming into his own now, twenty-five years after his death. Orperhaps it's simply because truth and beauty will always, eventually, findtheir way to the light.<p>&nbsp;</p></FONT><i>Robin Frederick is a professional songwriter, music producer andrecording artist.
