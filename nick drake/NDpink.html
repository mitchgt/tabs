Nick played it live at Queen Elizabeth Hall, 21st February 1969. It was dropped from inclusion on 'Bryter Layter', a fact that made Joe Boyd very disappointed.<br> <TD WIDTH=250 VALIGN=TOP>Please beware of them that stare<br>They'll only smile to see you

hide<br>You find reknown while people frown<br>At things that you say<br>But say what you'll say<br>About the farmers and the fun<br>And the things behind the sun<br>And the people round your
