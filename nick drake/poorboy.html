It canbe divided into four 8 bar sections comprising summarised AABA  - ie there aretwo sections more or less the same, followed by a different passage. The songsequence ends with a  final section in the initial pattern. A series of these 32bar  patterns make up the performance.  PB is not at all like this. If  the  4bar vamp which turns the song around is included, this is a 36 bar sequence ofthe form ABACDE.<BR><BR>Most songs are quite obviously in one particular key whereas PB oscillatesbetween C major and C minor.<BR><BR>One comparitor  is John Lennon's song <FONT SIZE=2>I'LL BE BACK</FONT> on the second (non-film) sideof the  <FONT SIZE=2>A HARD DAY'S NIGHT</FONT> LP. Ian MacDonald - a contemporary of Nick's atCambridge, also reading English and who also left before taking his finals, says of <FONT SIZE=2>I'LL BE BACK</FONT> in his book on the Beatles, <FONT SIZE=2>REVOLUTION IN THE HEAD</FONT>:<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>        "I'll Be Back is a melancholy essay in major/minor        uncertainty mirroring the emotional instability of the lyric. The most        unorthodox thing Lennon had then written, being constructed as a        twelve bar verse in two equal sections, a six and a half bar bridge        and a nine bar middle. Despite all this, and as so often with Lennon's         more bewildering constructions, the whole thing rings    totally true,         being his deepest emotional expression to date."</FONT> <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>POOR BOY</FONT> is made up as follows - there is:<BR><BR>* an 8 bar A section "Never sing_..share of labour";<BR>* a 4 bar B section "I'm a poor boy_..over my shoulder";<BR>*  a 2 bar A' section;<BR>*  an 8 bar C section "Nobody knows_..cross their stiles",<BR>*  a 10 bar D section "A poor boy_..stay tonight"  and<BR>*   a 4 bar Cminor/F vamp (E) to turn the song round.<BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>- RHYTHM -</B></FONT><BR><BR>The basic rhythm pattern is a samba. As written in <A HREF="../DRAKE/NDsongcollection.html">The Nick Drake songbook</A>, thesong is actually in 8:8 - it is easiest to count each bar in "eights".  On thisbasis,  the first three beats are emphasised and the last five carry a moresyncopated pattern - a typical modern samba rhythm.<BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>- HARMONY -</B></FONT><BR><BR>The A section, made up of a 2-chord pattern repeated four times, is veryunusual in harmonic terms because of the way the second chord works. The bassline is a standard half step down between the tonic and the leading note (C toB).  The note G is common to both chords - so far so conventional. Indeedcountless songs and other pieces of  music start like this, for example <FONT SIZE=2>WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN</FONT> to just name one.<BR><BR>The first chord is a Cm7 and so contains the Eb major triad over a  C in the bass.The second chord slides this whole Eb triad down a half step to make a D majortriad which sits over the B in the bass and the G which is held over from thefirst bar.So the second chord is defined by 5 notes: B, G, A, D, F#  - not theeveryday currency of popular music - but much closer (say) to the kind of guitar harmony which John McLaughlin used to make an impact on his 1969 debut,<FONT SIZE=2>EXTRAPOLATIONS</FONT>.<BR><BR>There are many ways these harmonies could be analysed. For example they implytwo harmonically distinct scales for the improviser - the first is the majorscale of Bb centred on C and the second is the major scale of G major centre B.For anyone immersed in the jazz innovations which shaped the first half of the1960's, where chordal improvisation was replaced by scalar, they are aninvitation to have a ball - and indeed this is exactly what Chris MacGregor does onthis track when he gets his chance. Part of the reason for this is that thetransition between the scales offer the soloist so many impactful possibilities.The F# on the second chord - which lies a dissonant tri-tone away from the"home" note of the song - C - is  particularly appealing to the improviser.<BR><BR>Nick's melody line for the first phrase  of the A section ("never sing for mysupper") is centred on G. The second phrase starts  on G jumping up thendropping down through a B natural back to the G. The B would be moderatelyextreme with "normal" harmony but the oddity of theinnovatory 5 note chord underneath  sharpens up the "edge" of this note, complimenting the sense in the words and giving each response, eg "I never helpmy NEIGHbour", added bite. The whole A section gives a sensation of oscillationbetween two related but very distinct worlds.<BR><BR>With the opening of the B section, "I'm a Poor Boy," the mood and nature of theharmonic tension shifts. Things have moved on and indeed could be coming to aconclusion. There is a standard "II/V" pattern from the key of Ab major (someway from the G major of the second chord defining the A section pattern). Nick'smelody line continues to emphasise the note G but with this different harmonicunderpinning it has a completely different sense - it is a leading note, acentre of tension which would be released by the half step up to Ab, (ie II,V,I)which of course never comes. A protracted period of II/V changes is quite acommon device for building a particular kind of tension. Songs which do this areoften very popular as vehicles for jazz - <FONT SIZE=2>SATIN DOLL</FONT> would be an example.<BR><BR>The two chords which make up the B section stand in a coherent relationship tothose in the A section. You may remember that in the A section,  part of the chordchange was a descending major triad - from Eb to D major. The B sectionstarts with a Db major triad (over a Bb root) - ie the triad has slipped afurther semitone. The second of the chords in the B section (the V chord) hastwo of the notes in the Db triad - the Db and the F. Strictly speaking they should bejoined by a G. The Songbook gives a very unusual voicing for the next chord whichI will pass over at this stage but there is a lot that might be said about thatchord alone. (Only Nick would have thought of playing it that way!) Suffice itto say that the harmony is very wound up and a move to Ab major would releasethat tension with a rush.<BR><BR>If the song took that direction the fundamental harmonic pattern would be III,IIIb, II,V,  I - like many other songs, including for example <FONT SIZE=2>MAN IN A SHED</FONT> - another of Nick's songs with a strong jazzy feel.<BR><BR>The tension  does not resolve in this way. The expectation that this song is"really" in Ab - is defeated by the 2 bar A section which is the repetition ofthe basic pattern of the first section - ie C minor is re-emphasised.Harmonically, the idea of  two related but distinct worlds is reinforced  - "Imay grow older".<BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>- STYLISTIC REFERENCES -</B></FONT><BR><BR>The "Nobody knows" C section reworks a little rhyme AA Milne wrote for hischaracter Pooh Bear: <FONT SIZE=2><BR><BR>The more it snows<BR>The more it goes<BR>The more it goes on snowing<BR><BR>And nobody knows<BR>How cold my toes<BR>How cold my toes are growing<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>(A.A.Milne, The House at Pooh Corner, 1928)</FONT><FONT SIZE=3><BR><BR>as compared to Nick's<BR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Nobody knows<br>How cold it grows<br>And nobody sees<br>How shaky my knees<br><BR>Nobody cares<br>How steep my stairs<br>And nobody smiles<br>If I cross their stiles.<br><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=3>It is accompanied by an over-familiar chord sequence,often found in country blues on the 11th bar of a 12 bar blues (or thereabouts)and evolve a "run down" using the interval of a major sixth which is easy toplay on the first and third string of the guitar. By this time, in this song, itis emerging that the songwriter may be having a game with us - having led us tobelieve the song might be in Ab major and built up  a lot of tension to thateffect,  then emphasising C minor he has decided to switch into C major andstarted to quote from the <FONT SIZE=2>HUMS OF POOH</FONT> and using a "standard" winding downmotif from the blues.<BR><BR> The dreaded girl singers appear on the scene. Do we really take this newattempt to relax the tension seriously?  The girl chorus often serve toliterally "back up" the singer - repeating his/her lines, complimenting themeaning with lines of their own or filling out the harmony. Many listeners reportthat they dislike these girls - and this may well be because they confound ourexpectations further - are they really on Nick's side?<BR><BR>They sound like a gospel or R&B group - so is this a "down-home" tune after all?That expectation is overturned in the D section which is an ironic comment on thestandard "I, IV" candence which characterises the blues. This "blues" cadenceoccurs  in the most unbluesy articulation possible. The second chordwhich ought to be the essence of the blues carries an E natural over from theinititial tonic chord  to provide a major seventh on the subdominant - if itwere a blues, the E would fall to Eb and give a typical blues seventh dissonance. To complicate matters more, the bass note of the second chord is an A - ie thesubdominant is in the first inversion - not a blues figuration. It is as if thewriter has taken the blues and deliberately settled on the most Europeanpossible inflection of those harmonies.<BR><BR>The last part of the first bar in the D section building up to the subdominantis made up of stacked fourths - the notes of the chord are C, F, Bb, E - a verysophisticated musical device. The bit of musical history where you are mostlikely to find all these ingredients is arguably in the compositions of Ravel orSatie.<BR><BR>The song finally gets to its point of harmonic resolution - "where willhe stay?"-  and even then lingers a bit before getting to the final point ofresolution. Having spent the D section building up the thought that this song isreally in C major, it immediately switches (again against expectations) backfrom C major to C minor for the E section. This  is a relatively uncontroversialC minor/F vamp. After all that has gone on before, not least the Satie episode, eventhis straightforward tonic/subdominant progression assumes quite a mockingquality. You might expect that final resolution into C minor to be a moment ofbathos, but the nervous energy only falters for a split-second. Expectations areturned over again - the Eb triad in the first chord of the vamp goes up a toneto make a F major triad in the second. In other words, the turn around hasrising harmonies contrary to the various falling patterns that have been sopredominant up until this point.<BR><BR>So there is an awful lot of art and artifice in the construction of the song.I leave it for the list to judge how far the critical vocabulary which Ianused to analyse the Lennon song is appropriate to this one, ie "bewilderingcomplexity/emotional instability/emotional depth".<BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>- BOSSA NOVA & JOBIM -</B></FONT><BR><BR>The question of the bossa nova was also raised recently in the newsgroup  - inmany ways this song is similar to the best work of A C Jobim - Brazil's Gershwin- the kind of things he was writing at the end of the 60s when presumably thesuccess of the earlier tunes like <FONT SIZE=2>GIRL FROM IPANEMA</FONT> meant that he could writeexactly what he felt like. Strange harmonic shifts, eccentric section lengths,the mundane and the exotic all mixed up together, are very much typical of Jobim.A good example of this would be the song <FONT SIZE=2>TRISTE</FONT> - it has the Nick-like deviceof starting some way through the first bar, it switches from major to minor, itis a mixture of quite standard chord progressions and rather large andsurprising harmonic jumps and it is on the rather Nick-like theme of a man whohas to leave his love because he finds the strain of being near her so great.<BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>- INSTRUMENTALISTS -</B></FONT><BR><BR>I also want to say something about the two lead instrumentalists on thistrack. But let me mention first that there seem to be two guitar parts - oneacoustic and one electric - on left and right - I have no idea if they areboth Nick.<BR><BR>Tony Reif of Songlines wrote about Chris McGregor, the pianist on this track, so Idon't need to repeat that. However, his solo is a gem - the tune is fast anywayand Chris plays mostly in semi-demi -quavers which is technically prettydemanding. Nonetheless he varies this subtly, sometimes putting more notes in,sometimes fewer according to taste as his line requires.  From around 3.30 to3.38 Chris makes the most of the drama inherent in the A section harmonies byplaying phrases which alternately emphasise the G and the F# but then as hemoves through the B section these two notes also feature in the line he creates.Their "meaning" or melodic force has changed because the harmonies have altered- they give a funky flavour or bluesy flavour to this passage but pretty much instyle of Horace Silver.<BR><BR>The rhetorical posture of the jazz soloists on this track is worth a moment'sreflection. Chris in particular is using quite a modern style of playing - notparticularly curbing himself to appease the audience's sensibilities. There is arumour that he was called into the studio and recorded his contribution in onetake - if so it would not be the first time that good jazz has been recorded inthis way. This "first take" approach is valued by some jazzmen because itemphasises the values of authenticity and spontaneity which are at the heart ofthe jazz ethic. There is no greater crime in jazz than to play the same solowith the same inflections night after night - not a point of view Nicksubscribed to at all. So perversely, Chris's approach stands in ironiccounterpoint to the position of the singer and writer who (it appears) hasdecided to manipulate the audience's expectations rather craftily on manydifferent levels. Nick's considered, mannerist approach is set against theimpulsive rush of McGregor's creativity.<BR><BR>The track is 6 minutes long and so the producer probably thought there wasn'ttime to let the alto player, Ray Warleigh, take a crack at the changes which isa shame because it is clear from the obligato passages that he is on good form.Ray played on a number of John Martyn LP's in this era. I last heard him  acouple of years ago when the London Sinfonietta, the UK's premier ensemblespecialising in 20th century music, delighted a packed Royal Festival Hall byrecreating most of the classic Miles Davis/Gil Evans charts. The lead trumpetduties were split between the relevant Brecker Brother and  Guy Barker - Ray hadthe alto chair - not the easiest of slots but a wonderful night's music.<BR><BR>I mean to write more about Ray Warleigh's playing on <FONT SIZE=2>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT> on anotheroccasion - in particular the poise which he so consistently maintains.<BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2><B>- CONCLUSION -</B></FONT><BR><BR>Does all this oddity and ambiguity mean we have to like the track? Well, not atall - to be honest I never really liked BL when it first came out and itis the last of the 4 "units" of Nick's that I've bought prompted mainly by theresurgence of interest in his music surrounding Patrick's book. It is quitepossible than no one involved in creating this track is setting out to make thelistener feel comfortable and have her/his preconceptions validated.<BR><BR>But I think I'll keep listening to <FONT SIZE=2>POOR BOY</FONT> pretty carefully for a while yet.For a start I am very curious about how it might link up with two other songswhich jump backwards and forwards between major and minor tonality - <FONT SIZE=2>RIVER MAN</FONT>and <FONT SIZE=2>AT THE CHIME OF A CITY CLOCK</FONT>...<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>© I A I N &nbsp; C A M E R O N &nbsp; S E P T E M B E R &nbsp; 1 9 9 8<BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>Iain Cameron went up to Selwyn College to read Moral Sciences in Autumn 1968and was given a room on the same side of the quad as Brian Wells.
