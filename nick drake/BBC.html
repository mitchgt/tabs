Our films are movingand uplifting tributes to various rock and music stars such as DustySpringfield,  Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison,  seen through the eyes oftheir fans and friends.  The films are made up of archive footage (of whichthere is virtually none of Nick!) and music intercut with filming in thevicinity of the stars' shrine or memorial on the day of the anniversary oftheir passing away.  Each film includes interviews with those who have cometo pay tribute to these truly memorable musicians,  including fans, friendsand colleagues.  <BR><BR>We have already made films about legendary musicians such as John Lennon(set at Strawberry Fields in New York),  Kurt Cobain,  Buddy Holly,  JeffBuckley and Jimi Hendrix amongst others.  The series will be transmitted onthe new BBC digital channel BBC Choice and is likely to be shown on BBC2 inthe New Year.  The programmes will each be approximately fifteen minuteslong. <BR><BR>We are planning to make a film about Nick Drake as part of the series oftributes.  The overall aim would be to make a really moving documentarywhich would clearly show his legacy on music and fans today.  We haveabsolute faith in the fact that we could make a really beautiful film whichwould give a sense of what made Nick so important to his many fans.   <BR><BR>We intend to film on the 25th November at the cemetery in Tanworth in Arden.I have spoken to the vicar at St Mary Magdalene who says that they have fansvisiting throughout the year, leaving little gifts so we feel that this is aplace where fans can congregate and pay their respects to Nick.   We wouldvery much like to talk to any fans who might be going along on the 25th andwould also like to encourage people to come along even if they've never beenbefore.<BR><BR> If you're interested or have got any questions: send an e-mail to <a href=mailto:kate.patten@bbc.co.uk>Kate Patten</a> at the BBC.<BR><BR>	</TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
