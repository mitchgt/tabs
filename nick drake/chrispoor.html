I mustacknowledge the use of the Music Sales Nick Drake songbook, whoseversion whilst similar to my first one was pitched further up theneck and made several improvements; this one features severalimprovements on the book version, particularly in the use of a capo (which makes it not so impossible to play), but also someof the chords themselves.I'll make no attempt to represent the strumming / picking pattern,but it's pretty obvious from the track.Intro:57555x  x57555Verse:57555x 47444x  four times37333x x37333  four times57555x 47444x  "Nobody knows..."x0565x x0454x x0343(3) x02420   twice"A poor boy.."x02220 x00020 2x023x (x4; you can do the riff as 023 on B string)(there's a major seventh in the third chord - can't decide whether2x022x is better for solo guitar. see what you think)"he may say every day"020200 020100 x2Tabbed by Chris Healey</BODY></HTML></pre><!Unregistered version.
