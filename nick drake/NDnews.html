They hope to make the film, and hopefully an accompanying book, as definitive as possible.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Nick studied at Fitzwilliam College for two years, dropping out when his first album was released.   Understandably many of the songs were written while he lived in Cambridge. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;   Although he died over 20 years ago, Nick Drake's music is still admired.   Among his fans are current favourites REM, Paul Weller, Oasis and the Boo Radleys.   If you knew Nick and would like to contribute to the film, you can write to the film's producer, David Barber, at Sound Techniques Ltd in Hampstead Avenue, Mildenhall, Suffolk, IP28 7AS.<BR>   Alternatively you can ring them on (01638) 713631".<BR><BR>David Barber in Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter:<BR><BR>"We've come about half way through.
