It's okay.' Maybe one or two. <I>Every</I> &nbsp; other time, people come back and they say, 'Wow, that's amazing!' You listen to Nick Drake and you become a convert.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson:</B> During his tragically short career, Nick Drake never had a hit single, played only a handful of gigs and , as far as I know, gave only one press interview. My name's Danny Thompson, and I was very fortunate not only to know him, but to have played double bass on many of his songs. Today, nearly twenty-five years after he died, Nick's records sell all around the world and artists like REM, Kate Bush, Paul Weller and Everything But The Girl sing his praises. Here's Nick's producer, Joe Boyd.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd:</B> Nick, in a way, he said it all. I mean, he predicted it. You can almost see him wilfully setting this whole thing up. God knows why. But why would a young man of nineteen, with his whole future ahead of him, write a song like <FONT SIZE=1>FRUIT TREE</FONT>? 'Fame can never flourish till its stock is in the ground'. I mean, it's extraordinary.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson:</B> Just visit a record shop anywhere in the world and you'll meet a Nick Drake fan. I meet 'em all the time - all over the world. They come up and ask me questions about Nick. And just to prove it, in the heart of Manhattan, we got this response from the fifth customer we approached.<BR><BR><B>The Fifth Customer: </B>I just bought two of his CDs: <FONT SIZE=1>PINK MOON</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=1>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT>. I listen to public radio here, from Fordham University, and they play him.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>So just how does an English, ex-public school boy, who died virtually unknown, come to have fans all around the globe? Well, during the next hour, I'll be playing some of Nick's music; talking to his family, his friends, and people like me who worked on his records. Among them engineer John Wood and, first, producer Joe Boyd.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd: </B>John and I have both been very fortunate - our paths have crossed with some great musicians. I don't wanna sort of putting them in one-through-five order, you know, but certainly I can't remember having... you know, very rarely have I ever had more fun in the studio than working with Nick. And there are very few records that I can listen to with as much pleasure - you know, all those many years later - that I worked on, as the ones I worked on with Nick.<BR><BR><B>John Wood: </B>He was very easy to work with because he just sat down and did it; and he sang and played always at the same time. He played with great skill and control, and the guitar sound he made was extraordinary. We had several instances, that other people would come to Sound Techniques because they wanted the Nick Drake guitar sound, and invariably of course would never get it because it wasn't anything we did. I mean, he did it.<BR><BR><B>Molly Drake:</B> He was always interested in music. There was music going on in the family the whole time. We were all into music in a very big way, and Nick as a little tiny child of about one would get up and be conducting away - every time any music started on, Nick would stand and conduct. And we always used to say, 'He's going to be a famous conductor.' Really from then on - I mean, it was music the whole time. It was just the main part of his life I think.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>Nick Drake's mother Molly. God bless her. Nick's story starts a world away from that of most rock and pop stars, in Burma, in the final days of the British Empire. His parents met there, married and stayed on; and when Nick was four the Drakes returned to England and settled in the Warwickshire village of Tanworth-in-Arden. Nick's sister is the actress Gabrielle Drake. <BR><BR><B>Gabrielle Drake: </B>Mum composed songs right from...I mean, I can never remember a time when my mun wasn't playing a new song of hers on the piano. But I think it's probably easy to see where Nick got his talent from.<BR><BR><B>Molly Drake: </B>To begin with I started learning him the piano - which was fairly disastrous. But we plugged on, and then he went to school and had some proper lessons; and it was one of the proudest days of my life when he said to me, 'Oh mum, I'm glad you made me go on, because now it's my favourite thing.' <BR><BR><B> Danny Thompson: </B>After prep school, Nick went to public school at Marlborough - very posh! He sang in the choir and played clarinet and saxophone, but it was the guitar that really caught his imagination.<BR><BR><B>Gabrielle Drake:</B> I came across the chap who taught him guitar at Marlborough, and he said it was absolutely sickening [laughter], because after six months or so, Nick not only knew everything that he could teach him, but far outstripped him in playing as well.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd: </B>One of the reasons those records sound as good as they do is because you had this guitar as the spine of all those mixes - I mean, that was the absolute centrepiece. Even if it wasn't the loudest or the most prominent thing in some of the mixes, it was the thing that defined where everything else sat; and it was just so strong and so clean and so regular and so... I don't know, I just think he was an absolutely extraordinary guitarist. <BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>That musical talent quickly began to develop and, in March 1967, an eighteen-year-old Nick Drake was on holiday in Marrakesh with friends. So were The Rolling Stones, and Nick wrote a letter to his family about the encounter.<BR><BR><B>Gabrielle Drake [reading from the letter]:</B> <I>'...We saw The Stones eating in a small restaurant, and Bob, displaying once more his nerve, marched in and told them I wanted to play the guitar for them. Surprisingly enough they accepted this time, so I went in and did them a few numbers. We in fact got quite chatty with them, and it was quite interesting learning all the inside stories...'</I><BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson. </B>By the time he went up to Cambridge to study English, Nick had written several songs of his own, and one day fellow student Robert Kirby got a knock on his door.<BR><BR><B>Robert Kirby:</B> Nick came in with his guitar and said that some mutual friends of ours had said that I was a music student, and could possibly orchestrate some of his material. We'd already realised that we were talking around, basically, string quartets. Really we both accepted that George Martin's arrangements for <FONT SIZE=1>YESTERDAY</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=1>ELEANOR RIGBY</FONT> were excellent, innovative arrangements. <BR> &nbsp; What we would do was, Nick would play the guitar and I - it sounds quite boring - I would write down, note for note, every note he played on the guitar, just in sketch form. For example, I think, if you know the music, the start of <FONT SIZE=1>DAY IS DONE</FONT>, you have the... [<FONT SIZE=1>DAY IS DONE</FONT> is played]. <BR> &nbsp; I'd come to university to read music, and I'd always imagined that my future would be Handel's <FONT SIZE=1>MESSIAH</FONT>, Gilbert and Sullivan and [missing name] every term for the rest of my life. I was going to be a school master. I didn't know what else you could do. But here suddenly musicians could do arrangements. It was very exciting, yes.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>Every unknown artist needs a break, and Nick got his when he managed to get a spot on the bill supporting Country Joe and the Fish at the Roundhouse in London. Ashley Hutchings, bass player with Fairport Convention, heard his set.<BR><BR><B>Ashley Hutchings:</B> And the first thing that struck me was, not the sound, not the music, but the image. I thought he looked like a star. He looked wonderful. He stood very upright - charisma was shining through. That made me want to get a bit closer. I started to take in everything else: what a good guitarist he was, his picking. As soon as he came off stage, I made a beeline for him and started to talk to him and said that I thought his music was wonderful and could I have a phone number. I went away and immediately contacted Joe Boyd and said, 'Joe, listen, you really should have this number. You really should ring Nick Drake.' <BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd: </B>So I called him, and he came in. In those days we didn't have cassettes - he brought a reel-to-reel tape, that he'd done at home. And I don't think I listened to it right then and there - I may have - but my recollection is of playing it later that day, or the next day, or something; and just immediately, half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And I called him up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, 'I'd like to make a record', and he stammered, 'Oh well, yeah, okay.' Nick was a man of few words. He seemed pleased, in hos own diffident way. And we started talking about where to begin.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>At the same time as being an undergraduate at Cambridge, Nick began recording his debut album with John Wood and Joe Boyd.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd: </B>Hearing him play just triggered all sorts of ideas about string arrangements and backing voices and all sorts of different things; and this was early '68 or something, and so there was very much in the air records like Donovan records, The Beatles records, The Beach Boys records - you know, there was a lot of putting, laying textures on. [<FONT SIZE=1>I WAS MADE TO LOVE MAGIC</FONT> is played]<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B><FONT SIZE=1>I WAS MADE TO LOVE MAGIC</FONT>, from the first Nick Drake session. Nick though didn't like the arrangements - surprise, surprise. Who can blame him? Instead he suggested using those of his Cambridge friend, Robert Kirby.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd: </B> So the first one was <FONT SIZE=1>WAY TO BLUE</FONT>. They rather startled me, and John I think, by announcing there would be no guitar - it would just be Nick with the strings. And it was a quartet - a double quartet, it was eight, yeah. And I remember I was sitting up in the control room and trying... you know, curious to hear what this was going to sound like. And I think they may have been rehearsing it, but John was plugging in microphones and positioning microphones, and I just thought, well I'll just not worry about it until it's all happening. And then John would listen to one - you know, to the violas, and to the cellos, and to this - and to hear these kind of intriguing lines, I was kind of getting more and more impatient; and I remember I think John kind of snapped at me because I was saying, 'Come on, I wanna hear the whole thing.' He said, 'Just be patient.' And so, finally, all the mic faders came up, and we heard Nick singing; and John and I looked at each other and said, 'This is just amazing. This is just gorgeous.'And we were just absolutely stunned.<BR><BR><B>John Wood: </B>I mean, to have that sort of sound out of a section like that is just extraordinary. Having this fresh-faced youth who'd never done anything before come in and stand there and do it, to an old cynic, I thought, 'Oh yes, well, what's gonna happen now then?'<BR><BR><B>Robert Kirby: </B>I was astounded by Nick's professionalism. If I was standing at the front and going, 'Two, three... Oh, we'll take it from bar 37,' he was perfect. Precise every time. Since then I've done lots of arrangements - and you arrive in the studio, and the musician will have totally re-written the song, and not realise why it doesn't fit with the arrangement. But Nick was very professional - recorded that live.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>Sessions for the album continued for several months - but there was one song that needed a different sound.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd:</B> They just said to me, 'We need to talk about <FONT SIZE=1>RIVER MAN</FONT>.' And Robert said, 'I really don't think I'm up to it.' And by this time I thought Robert was a genius. You know, I said, 'Come on, Robert, what are you talking about? Of course you're up to it.' And he said, 'No, really, I just don't... I know what Nick wants, and I can't do it.'<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>The man who could was arranger Harry Robinson. Nick wanted <FONT SIZE=1>RIVER MAN</FONT> to echo some of his favourite classical composers.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd:</B> Nick and I went out to visit him, and it was great. Harry was great. He was very straightforward, no nonsense. 'Okay, what's the job? What's the task?' Nick sat there and he played him the song, and then he hummed some lines that he had in mind for a string part; and he mentioned some composers. I think he mentioned Delius. <BR><BR><B>John Wood:</B> I remember Ravel.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd:</B> And Harry kind of nodded and said, 'Yeah, okay, okay - got it,' and he went away. Harry turned up at the studio two weeks later with the...<BR><BR><B>John Wood:</B> With the business.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd:</B> Yeah. And we did it live. All those things were done live - vocal and guitar and everything.<BR><BR><B>Paul Wheeler:</B> I wasn't so aware of the earlier songs, but while I knew Nick he wrote <FONT SIZE=1>RIVER MAN</FONT>. And I remember the first time he played that to me, I felt that was really an exceptional song. And it caught this sort of dreamlike atmosphere that was around at the time. It was always that sense of being suspended when you heard Nick play: that everything would kind of close down, like he'd play in this kind of vacuum. Other people when they played would kind of fiddle about first, and play a few chords and things. Nick would never do that. Every time that he played it would be just perfect, and everybody would kind of stop and listen to him.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson:</B> That was Paul Wheeler. Another musician who got to know Nick Drake while at Cambridge. And while he was six-foot-three-inches tall, Nick was a distinctive figure indeed.<BR><BR><B>Paul Wheeler:</B> When you first saw Nick, you'd have this impression of incredible elegance - I mean, he had this kind of way of looking very elegant and very poised. And then when you got closer you'd find in fact that the jacket was all crumpled, and the jeans didn't quite fit. So there was this kind of combination between being very elegant on first impression, but then rather rough and ready when you were closer to him.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson:</B> <FONT SIZE=1>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT>, by Nick Drake, appeared in September 1969. It came as a copmlete surprise to his sister, Gabrielle.<BR><BR><B>Gabrielle Drake:</B> I knew that Nick was sort of recording, and I remember Joe Boyd coming round; and very shortly thereafter, Nick turned up in my room and said, 'There you are,' and threw down onto my bed <FONT SIZE=1>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT>. I couldn't believe my eyes. I had no idea that it had got to that stage.<BR><BR><B>Robert Kirby:</B> He realised he had to maintain the impetus of <FONT SIZE=1>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT>, and get another album out as quickly as he could - and a batter album. Nick had an ambitious streak. He knew what he wanted: he wanted success as a singer-songwriter, performer. And he was convinced that he had the talent to do it.<BR> &nbsp; There was a noticeable attempt on Nick's part to make the album "popular". <FONT SIZE=1>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT>, I think, has actually got single-material on it. I think it's still a wonderful album. I think it's a very up, happy album. There's some very good lyrics and very good songs on it.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson:</B> To the mass market the name Nick Drake was still unknown - so he dropped out of Cambridge and went on the road. Armed with just a guitar, Nick found performing life hard going and halfway through a short tour of university clubs - no surprise - he called Joe Boyd and said he couldn't do any more. In fact he never played live again.<BR> &nbsp; Though <FONT SIZE=1>FIVE LEAVES LEFT</FONT> hadn't been a commercial success, work on the follow-up, <FONT SIZE=1>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT>, began straight away. And Nick's move to London was reflected in his songs for the new album. [<FONT SIZE=1>AT THE CHIME OF A CITY CLOCK</FONT> is played]<BR> &nbsp; <FONT SIZE=1>AT THE CHIME OF A CITY CLOCK</FONT>, from <FONT SIZE=1>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT> - regularly voted one of the best albums of all time. Engineer John Wood has worked on thousands of recording sessions with artists around the world.<BR><BR><B>John Wood:</B> I think that, if you make a record, and you can just sit back and say, 'Well, there's nothing that I don't like about this. There's nothing that I wished I'd done - tweeked this, done that, done the other.' And you can just sit back and say, 'That's as good as I can get it,' then that's <FONT SIZE=1>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT> for me. That's the one. The only one.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson:</B> Sessions were fitted in around projects that Joe Boyd and John Wood working on with other artists. Among them jazz pianist Chris McGregor - he stayed around to hear Nick record a new track. This was <FONT SIZE=1>POOR BOY</FONT>. <BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd:</B> I turned around and I looked at Chris, and he was sitting back there, and I said, 'So what do you think of this?'<BR> &nbsp; And he said, 'Oh, it's nice man, it's nice.'<BR> &nbsp; I said, 'Well, go on and play on it then.' So I told John to mic up the piano, and I sort of told Nick over the intercom: I said, 'Hey Nick, we got a piano player comin' down.'<BR> &nbsp; And Nick said, 'Oh, okay.' And he just went and sat down and started playing. And that's the first take.<BR> &nbsp; Chris died about six years ago, and his brother came to see me, to visit London, to talk about - he wanted to meet people who'd been involved with Chris. And he'd never heard it. I mentioned it to him, and he said, 'What's that track?' I said, 'You don't know it?' I sat him down in my office and I played him <FONT SIZE=1>POOR BOY</FONT>, with Chris's solo, and he was in tears. I mean, it's a wonderful, wonderful solo. I don't know - that was one of those moments in the studio where the hairs stand up on your arms.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>Another musician who found himself working with Nick was John Cale, once of The Velvet Underground. He too heard some of Nick's songs, and <I>demanded</I> that Joe Boyd let him work on the tracks. <BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd: </B>And he said, 'I wanna talk to him,' you know, 'I wanna do some stuff on this record.'<BR> &nbsp; I said, 'Well, you better talk to Nick about it.'<BR> &nbsp; He says, 'Okay, so what's his phone number? Where is he? Get him on the phone.' And so I picked up the telephone, from the studio, and called Nick, and Nick answered, 'Hello.'<BR> &nbsp; 'Oh, hi, Nick, it's Joe.'<BR> &nbsp; 'Oh, hi.'<BR> &nbsp; I said, 'have you heard of John Cale?' [laughter]<BR> &nbsp; 'Yes. Yes. I guess so, yeah.'<BR> &nbsp; 'Well, he's here and he wants to come over and see you.'<BR> &nbsp; And John said, 'Tell him I'll be there in fifteen minutes.'<BR> &nbsp; And I said, 'He'll be there in fifteen minutes, Nick.'<BR> &nbsp; 'Oh, okay.' And he sounded very worried. And I gave John the address, and he walked out into Kings Road, got a cab and went to Hampstead.<BR> &nbsp; Two days later I get a phone call, the basic gist of which is that they've been together ever since - John's you know, sort of sieged Nick - playing ideas and working things out. 'We wanna come to the studio. We wanna do these tracks. Book me some time. We need a hammond, a celeste...' You know, he just ordered all up these things. And we said, 'Okay,' and in he came - and that's <FONT SIZE=1>NORTHERN SKY</FONT> and <FONT SIZE=1>FLY</FONT>. And Nick was kind of trailing along in his wake. <BR> &nbsp; I said, 'Nick, are you happy with this?'<BR> &nbsp; 'Yeah, yeah, I guess so.' And I think he was. [<FONT SIZE=1>NORTHERN SKY</FONT> is played]<BR><BR><B> Danny Thompson: </B> <FONT SIZE=1>NORTHERN SKY</FONT>, from Nick Drake's second album <FONT SIZE=1>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT>. Great stuff. Absolutely fantastic. By the time it was released, in late 1970, Nick was starting a slow spiral into depression. The album's lack of commercial success only added to his disenchantment. And family and friends recognised he was becoming more and more withdrawn. Nick's sister, Gabrielle.<BR><BR><B>Gabrielle Drake: </B>This sort of manifested itself with a true physical illness to begin with. He had a kidney stone which was very, very painful. And he disappeared in London, which was a great worry to my parents. And I remember them coming down and us searching for him.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>His arranger, Robert Kirby.<BR><BR><B>Robert Kirby: </B>Apart from his home, his parental home, I never saw - and I went to most places where Nick lived - it was never a home, it was always temporary, like a very empty room with a guitar and, you know, sort of old cartons of milk. The kind of thing you see in films when someone isn't staying there long. I never saw Nick comfortable in London - well, by what we consider comfortable. I don't know if it was part of the image thing.<BR> &nbsp; Nick would come round to see you and possibly not talk. Again, I suppose these days, one would try and get somebody to talk, or ask them what the problem was. I was always in awe of Nick, very much looked up to him. And sometimes you thought that that was his way. And I think it was his way.   I don't know what I could have done to help. He  very rapidly got worse, I think. I mean, from the time we were at Cambridge to the time of <FONT SIZE=1>PINK MOON</FONT> was a very rapid decline.<BR> &nbsp; As time progressed, I think the failure is what got to him. When people he respected told him how good he was he couldn't understand why it wasn't happening.<BR><BR><B> Danny Thompson: </B>All Nick's frustrations were poured into his final album, <FONT SIZE=1>PINK MOON</FONT>. This is engineer John Wood.<BR><BR><B>John Wood: </B>After <FONT SIZE=1>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT>, every now and then, I'd have a phone call from Nick; or Nick would turn up in Suffolk and stay for a couple of days - sit around with the kids. And I'd say, 'Are you gonna make another record?' and he would just shrug his shoulders. And then suddenly out of the blue I got this phone call: 'I wanna make a record.' And the studio was very busy at the time, and the only times we could get in were after sessions that finished at 11 o'clock at night. So we went in there, 11 o'clock in the evening. He sat there and probably did five or six songs - was very quiet throughout, and just came up and said, 'Fine, fine.'<BR> &nbsp; So I said, 'Well, we'll do some more tomorrow if you like?' So, go in the following night and do another four or five songs.<BR> &nbsp; I just assumed at some point he was going to say, 'Well, I want to get hold of Robert.' So I turned around and said, 'What are you going to put on them?'<BR> &nbsp; He said, 'I don't want anything on them.'<BR> &nbsp; I said, 'Absolutely nothing?'<BR> &nbsp; He said, 'No, that's it. That's all I want.' And the record is in fact, I think, 11 minutes on one side, and 12 minutes on the other. And it certainly doesn't want to be any longer. And we just mixed it, very quickly - and that was <FONT SIZE=1>PINK MOON</FONT>.<BR> &nbsp; I find it a very stark record, and I suppose that is certainly what he wanted. If he wanted himself in all his tortured reality, that's it.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B><FONT SIZE=1>PINK MOON</FONT>, like the Nick Drake albums before it, didn't do well at all, and Nick suffered a mental breakdown. He was prescribed anti-depressants and returned home to live with his parents. <BR><BR><B>Gabrielle Drake: </B>Good days in my parents' home were good days for Nick. And that was what their life revolved around really. You know, he would suddenly take off in the car, and they wouldn't know where he was going to, and they really couldn't ask. He wouldn't tell - because he also made it clear to them that he didn't want their interference either. But, you see, he then ran out of petrol, and would be unable to go into a garage to get petrol. So he'd ring up. It became a regular feature in their lives. They'd say, 'Okay, Nick, where are you now?' And they'd set off to get him.<BR><BR><B>Robert Kirby: </B>I think that one only has to look at the music to see how intelligent and observant he was, and therefore he must have known and seen what was happening to him, but he couldn't actually control his own future. There was one point where he needed other people, and that was to go and buy his records. And that he couldn't control.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>Nick also took out his frustrations on his producer Joe Boyd.<BR><BR><B>Joe Boyd: </B>One day I was in London, sitting at home and the phone rang, and Nick was on the phone, in a pay phone, and he was very agitated, and he said, 'I wanna talk to you.'<BR> &nbsp; And I said, 'Fine, come on over.' And he came over. I let him in, and he came upstairs, and he looked terrible: you know, his hair was dirty, and he was sort of unshaven, and his fingernails were dirty, and he was wearing a shabby coat. He wasn't the sort of diffident, quiet person I had remembered; he was very agitated, very nervous, twitchy.<BR> &nbsp;He sat down and he immediately launched into this kind of tirade about his career, about money, and basically it was accusatory. He said, 'You've told me I'm great, but nobody knows me, nobody buys my records. I'm still living on handouts from the publishing company. I don't understand. What's wrong? Who's fault is this?' And he was very angry. And I tried to explain that there's no guarantees - that you can make a great record and sometimes it just doesn't sell.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson:</B> And so, faced with a musical career that had failed to take off, Nick looked for another way to earn a living. Incredible really. His father managed to get him a job training, would you believe, as a computer programmer. Nick's mother, Molly.<BR><BR><B>Molly Drake: </B>Rodney found someone who would take him on, and they took him on, and he passed a few tests and things - much to our amazement really. But then they sent him straight off, down to some place where he was entirely alone - on a course, and he just chucked it. Oh, and then another time he thought he'd go into the army. Well, that was a pretty good disaster. He went for the interview and he didn't bother to even have his hair cut. It was down to his shoulders.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>Early in 1974 Nick went into the studio again, but he wasn't happy with the results.<BR><BR><B>Robert Kirby:</B> I think Nick knew that the end was coming, very much in the same way as when people talk about Mozart and the man in the black cloak who came. And so Mozart wrote what he thought was possibly his own requiem mass. Nick and one of the four last songs, <FONT SIZE=1>BLACK EYED DOG</FONT>, may have similarities.<BR><BR><B>Gabrielle Drake:</B> Nick went over to France and stayed on a houseboat with friends, and it was the most happy time because we really felt that Nick was starting to be able to stand on his own two feet. It was the last really happy time, because he came back of course and was not better; and it was very shortly thereafter that he took his overdose of Tryptizol.<BR> &nbsp; While I don't believe that anyone commits suicide who doesn't actually want to, somewhere very, very deep inside them - nevertheless I also think that he took those drugs on the spur of the moment. He didn't leave a note or anything like that. It was not premediated. And I think that he sort of thought, 'Well, either I'll die, or I'll come through this differently, or a different person,' or something. That's what I feel.<BR><BR><B>Danny Thompson: </B>Nick Drake died on November 25, 1974.
