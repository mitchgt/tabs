By the way, it is recommended to omit the 3in those chords. (As often in jazz-style pieces, 3 and 5 are sometimesomitted for sake of greater clarity. Try not to play more than 4 stringsin one chord!!!) The piano plays sometimes 9- or 11-chords where I wroteonly 7 or 9, and lots of other coloured stuff.How to play these chords? Until someone finds something better, I'd re-commend tuning down the 4th and 6th string one full step to get thevery seldom DACGBE tuning. This is not too different from standardtuning, so you can basically play the barre chords you're used to;as long as the bass note is on the 5th string. The 4th and 6th stringare only changed to make the bass notes a bit easier. Here is how thechords should be played: (Improvements welcome, because I'm no experi-enced jazz guitar player!)E -3-  -3-  -2-  -1-  -1-  -3-----2-----1-----0-   -3-   -3-  -3---3---1-B -4-  -4-  -3-  -2-  -1-  -5-----4-----3-----3-   -3-   -3-  -5---5---1-G -3-  -5-  -2-  -1-  -3-  -3-----2-----1-----0-   -5-   -4-  -5---3---2-C ---  ---  ---  ---  -3-  -0-----0-----0-----0-   ---   ---  -----------A -3-  ---  -2-  -1-  ---  ---------------------   ---   ---  -3---3-----D ---  -3-  ---  ---  ---  ---------------------   -5-   -5-  ---------3-   Cm7  F9   Bm7  Bbm7 Eb9  C7    B7/C  Bb7/C CaddD Gadd4 G    C   C7  FText in [  ] is sung by backup vocalists.transcribed by Andreas Gastel                  <gastel@mx.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de>using a transcription by Harlan L.
