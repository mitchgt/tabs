VALIGN=TOP>Black days of winter all were through<br>The blossoms came and they brought you<br>Clouds left the sky<br>And I knew the reason why<br>They made way for you and the blossom.<br><br>The seasons cycle turned again<br>An april shower now and then<br>Trees came alive<br>And the bees left their hive<br>They came out to see you and the blossom.<br><br>People were laughing, smiling with the sun<br>They knew that summer had begun.<br><br>The nights grew warm, the days grew long<br>Spring turned to summer and was gone<br>It seemed so fine<br>All the cider and the wine<br>But I knew you'd go with the blossom.<br><br>When spring returns I'll look again<br>To find another blossom friend<br>Until I do<br>Find something new<br>I'll just think of you and the blossom.</TABLE><br><A NAME="RAIN"></A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR SIZE="2"><BLOCKQUOTE><br><br><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=400 VALIGN=CENTER CELLPADDING=2><TD WIDTH=150 VALIGN=TOP><FONT

tops<br>Leading to the sea<br>This was our season, no lies and no pretend<br>But my love left with the rain.<br><br>Thoughts of springtime rainfall<br>Touching flowers that bend<br>Thoughts of wind in willows<br>Days that never end<br>This was our season, but sorrow waited round the bend<br>For my love left with the rain.<br><br>Rain's the way you move now<br>Sun the way you seem<br>Leaves the way you wonder<br>Flowers the way you dream<br>This was our season, and we said it couldn't end<br>But my love left with the rain.</TABLE><br><A

ease.<br><br>So go your way and I'll follow<br>Just lead the way.<br><br>Dancing to midsummer nightsongs<br>Sprayed by the warmth of the rain<br>Blurred in the heat of a landscape<br>Fly to the moon once again.<br><br>So go your way and I'll follow on the breeze<br>Float with such ease<br>Lead the way.</TABLE><br><A NAME="JOEY"></A></BLOCKQUOTE><HR

Saturday's gain.<br><br>As I sit in her city in fog and in steam<br>Everything's blurred, for blurred is my dream<br>So I'll leave for my terrace and tea laced with rum<br>And wait for the day when Joey will come.<br><br>And come all the dreams that never did try<br>To live on a memory or float on a sigh<br>Together we'll sit in the Saturday rain<br>And dream of Joey or Mary
