For a country renowned for exploring and assimilating the musical traditions of other cultures, it is ironic that the English have neglected their own. While the resurgence of Irish, Scots and Welsh identity is re-inforced by living, breathing folk traditions, the notion of what defines Englishness remains much more elusive. Long derided by many as irrelevant, 'English Folk' has been reclaimed and rebranded by a generation as at home with Beth Orton as they are with The Prodigy. Although this festival does not attempt to define English traditional music, or indeed Englishness, it does present an eccentric array of singular artists who all draw from the deep well of the English roots tradition. <BR><BR>In the Barbican Hall, <B>Martin Carthy</B> and <B>Norma Waterson</B> invite an array of guests including <B>Billy Bragg, Eliza Carthy, Bert Jansch</B>  and <B>Eddi Reader</B> to celebrate the 60th anniversary of English roots label <B>Topic Records</B>. <B>Nick Drake</B>, that most English of singer-songwriters, will be remembered in a special tribute concert featuring stars from rock, folk and classical music - amongst those confirmed so far are <B>Beth Orton, Bernard Butler</B> and <B>Ben & Jason </B>(many more tbc). <B>St. Giles' Church</B>, meanwhile,  will provide the perfect venue for the rare and wonderful voice of <B>June Tabor</B>. Throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday the Barbican Foyer's FreeStage will come alive with performances from an eclectic range of artists including <B>The Men They Couldn’t Hang, Martin Stephenson, Flook, Chris Wood & Andy Cutting</B> and <B>Edward II</B> amongst many others.<BR><BR>The concerts in the Barbican Hall, St Giles' Church and on the FreeStage will be accompanied throughout the weekend by Talks on <B>Topic Records, Nick Drake </B>and other themes thrown up by the festival.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><B>Fri 24 Sept, 7.30pm Barbican Hall:<BR>TOPIC RECORDS 60th Anniversary Concert		<BR>			Hosted by Waterson:Carthy + Special Guests<BR><BR></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>'Over the past 60 years, Topic Records has inspired generation after generation of singer-songwriters, both at home and abroad. Long may it continue to do so.'(Billy Bragg)<BR><BR>The oldest independent label in the world, Topic Records was established in 1939 to give 'a voice to the people' through its recordings and collections of British folksong. 60 years on Topic still continues to provide a dynamic link between past and present through its invaluable archive of historic recordings and new recordings of traditionally based artists. In this anniversary concert the truly legendary Norma Waterson and Martin Carthy (MBE), bring together established folk musicians with artists influenced and inspired by the tradition to pay their respects to a national treasure. Among those confirmed to perform are Eliza Carthy, Christine Collister, Billy Bragg, Eddi Reader, Roy Bailey, Tim Van Eyken, Bert Jansch, John Jones and members of The Oysterband, Dick Gaughan, Tom Robinson and Boo Hewerdine.<BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><B>Sat 25 Sept - 7.30pm Barbican Hall:<BR>A SPECIAL TRIBUTE TO NICK DRAKE		<BR><BR>		</B>		</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>'There is something rare and remarkable about Nick’s music. The purity of that voice, and the delicacy of those songs, combine to transcend time and fashion - beguiling those who weren’t born until after he died'(Patrick Humphries - Author of Nick Drake: The Biography)<BR><BR>Nearly 25 years after his death, the haunting power, elegance and poetry of Nick Drake’s music continues to attract and influence. In September 1999, it will be 30 years since the release of his acclaimed debut ‘Five Leaves Left’, an album still selling to legions of new fans falling love with his intricate guitar work, introspective songs and understated English voice. All the more poignant, then, that on his death (at the age of 26) Drake's talent was largely unrecognised. In this unique concert stars from rock, folk and classical music will be drawn together to pay tribute to this most cultish of singer-songwriters. Names so far confirmed are Beth Orton,  Bernard Butler and the emerging talent of Ben and Jason.<BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><B>Sat 25th Sept - 7.00pm St Giles' Church:<BR>JUNE TABOR										<BR><BR></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>'Quite simply, one of Britain’s greatest interpreters of popular song. She is a performer with an extraordinary range and the ability to mix intensity, passion and drama, with a chillingly lived in voice that makes every song sound like a personal experience'(The Guardian)<BR><BR>The intimate setting and acoustics of St Giles' Church will provide the perfect setting for a performance by Topic Records' very own June Tabor - one of the world's best known and highest respected folk and roots singers. With her distinctive voice of exquisite depth and drama, June Tabor has spanned the musical spectrum, working with artists such as Elvis Costello, the Albion Band, Fairport Convention in addition to her own stunning solo performances. She has been named Vocalist of the Year so often by Folk Roots magazine that the category was retired and a Hall of Fame honour created on her behalf, and Mojo magazine readers recently voted her one of the top 100 singers of all time. <BR><BR><BR><BR><B>Location:<BR>Barbican Centre, Silk Street, London, EC2Y 8DS<BR>Box office number: 0171 638 889.<BR><BR>Marketing & Publicity:<BR>Gill Keeble, Barbican Marketing Office<BR> Tel: 0171 382 7379 / Fax: 0171 382 7241<BR>gkeeble@barbican.org.uk<BR><BR>	Press:<BR>Miles Evans, Barbican Press Office<BR> Tel: 0171 638 5403 / Fax: 0171 382 7252<BR>mevans@barbican.org.uk</B></font face></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF="http://www.barbican.org.uk/"> Barbican Home Page</A> <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></TD>	</TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
