I'd met both of them through John Martyn, an extraordinary       guitarist and songwriter. When I arrived in London that spring,       fresh from school, I somehow had the good fortune to stumble through       his doorway in Hampstead, and for much of that summer he and his wife Beverly       took care of me; fed me, nursed me through an unhappy romance, and       listened with dignity if not patience as I began trying to write songs       on an oversized Gibson Hummingbird that seemed, in the London of 1970,       an overt display of opulence. (When I opened the case at Cousins, my guitar       got an ovation).<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;For all my enthusiasm, angst and earnestness, I was terrible, and in retrospectivethe kindness of that audience seems formidable, almost an act of internationalgood will. Nick Drake was also very bad, but for different reasons. His shynessand akwardness were almost transcendent. A tall man (he stood over 6'3"), his clothes - black corduroy jacket and pants, frayed white shirt - hung around him like bedclothes after a particularly bad night's sleep. He sat on a small stool, hunched tight over a tiny Guild guitar, beginning songs and, halfway through,  forgetting where he was and stumbling back to the start of that song, or beginning an entirely different song which he would then abandon mid-way through if he remembered the remainder of the first. He sang away from the microphone, mumbled, and whispered, all with a sense of precariousness and doom. It was like being at the bedside of a dying young man who wants to tell you a secret, but who keeps changing his mind at the last minute: Come closer; no, on second thought, go away.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;          There was a new song that he sang that night that he kept starting          and stopping, never completing; he finally just sang the opening          lines over and over over again: <I>Do you curse where you come from?/Do          you swear in the night?</I> (from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">HAZEY JANE I</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">)                    <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;          It was chilling and morbidly fascinating. No one took their eyes from him          for a second - there was a real sense of keeping him there with our gaze          and attention, that if we looked away, however briefly, he might disappear          or forget that we were there and go to sleep.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;          He could quite literally disappear from rooms, from people, from situations,          just as he eventually disappeared from his life. Once, late at night,          I was out driving with John & Beverly and a guitarist friend of theirs,          Paul Wheeler, on our way to an all-night Indian restaurant; we passed          Nick driving along in an old white Chevy and signalled for him to join is.          It was my first time at an Indian restaurant... I was still used to the           pot roasts and rubber chickens of American boarding schools, so I remember          the smell of curries and hot breads very clearly, remember the white linen          tablecloths and the white linen turbans on the waiters, the ubiquitous          cats sliding back and forth from the kitchen, and the strong smell of          hashish being smoked upstairs. We sat for hours, eating, drinking wine that          Paul had brought, and only when we stood up to pay the check did I realize          that Nick was with us, that he in fact <I>had</I> been with us for the          entire meal.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;None of which would mean very much if his music wern't extraordinary. In the courseof a very short life (he out-lived John Keats by about a year, which, with hisslightly morbid sensibility and his devotion to the whole Romantic ethos, wouldhave both amused and irritated him - in certain ways, he was very competitive), NickDrake recorded three albums of unmatched beauty and power that have actually movedpeople and touched people in ways that few records ever do. In concert and on record,his songs, his voice, and his arrangements seem so fragile and delicate that you'dthing the slightest breeze or sound from the street would blow them away or obliteratethem; but five years after his death, the songs seem stronger, more full-bodiedand more fully-rooted than they sounded six, seven, eight, or nine years ago.Like operas made of stone, they sing and they are quiet.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;  In his best work (and none of his recorded songs are less than good), there are   moments of true feeling and pure vision which truly transcend the influences -  Van Morrison's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">ASTRAL WEEKS</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">,  Tim Buckley's jazz-inflected vocals, Jim Webb's melodic patterns, the sambas of  Jao Gilberto, John Martyn's rolling, percussive guitar style - turning them into  extended moments that are purely cinematic, dense with images of every sort.  The songs are hypnotic, narcotic, black holes that it is possible to fall into  and lose yourself in.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;                     The songs are completely adolescent, but adolescent in the same way that Rimbaud is, in a way that magnifies adolescence. There is very little self pity and no anger whatsoever; the songs vacillate in mood between wonder and dismay. These are songs of barely remembered grace, of accumulated loss, of being in a shadow world where emotions are impossible. (or unreachable - the cuckoo locked inside the clock that emerges to mark the occasional hour) and change is unlikely; the songs of a man who is deathly afraid of angels, but who does not want to  bother with anyone or anything less.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;                              </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">FIVE LEAVES LEFT</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, Nick's          first album (released in 1969, when he was 21), remains the mostseductive record, probably the best introduction to his music: the arrangements aresparse but elegant, and the songs are haunting without having the desperate edge of</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">PINK MOON.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">BRYTER LAYTER</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, recorded andreleased a year later, contains Nick's most beautiful songs </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">(NORTHERN SKY, HAZEY JANE I)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">,but was the album he was least satisfied with. To compensate for</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">FIVE LEAVES LEFT</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">'s lack of success,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">BRYTER LAYTER</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> was slicker, morepolished, more "commercial." Individually, the songs are wonderful; more variedin tone and style and, if possible, more cryptic than the songs on</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">FIVE LEAVES LEFT</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">. Still, the albumfeels slightly askew, off-center; the arrangements are sometimes too pretty, andthe sense of desolation (which is deeper here, more rooted) is glossed over by theproduction, as if it were no more than a light breeze blowing through the record.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;         By the time of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">PINK MOON</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, twoyears later, what may have started as a light breeze had become a full-scale tempest.Recorded in two days, most of the songs recorded in one take, it is completely bareand unproduced, just Nick and his guitar with no other instruments, no overdubs exceptfor several notes of a piano that punctuate the title song.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;A few years later, and he really wasn't there. On November 25, 1974, he was found inhis bed at his family's home in Birmingham, dead from an overdose of a very strong anti-depressant, an apparent, though deabated, suicide.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;At the time, his death was not reported over here, did not even warrant mention in</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">ROLLING STONE</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">'s Random Notes.Slowly, over the last few years, though, a following has grown up around him: his songs turnup on the radio late at night; imports of his records turn up more and moreconsistently in stores, and last year Arthur Lubow published an excellentand painstakingly researched eulogy in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">NEW TIMES.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">This November, Antilles will release a three-record set of his music: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">FIVE LEAVES LEFT, BRYTER LAYTER</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">PINK MOON</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, along with four songshe recorded for an album he began just before his death.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;"When men have gone away," James Hanley wrote, "you may see clearly what they haveleft behind."<BR><BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="links"><A HREF="DRAKE.html">THE NICK DRAKE FILES HOMEPAGE</A><BR><BR></FONT><BR><BR></TD></TR></TABLE</BODY>
