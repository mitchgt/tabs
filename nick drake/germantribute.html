I became a young <I>Alternative Nation</I> citizen and I sacrificed much of my time and money to the Great Gods of the Nation - Sonic Youth, Pixies, Dinosaur Jr, H&uuml;sker D&uuml; et al. God knows I did also pay my fees to the, well, <I>less</I> great subgods. <BR><BR>Now, this was the era around 1988-1991 when the word <I>indie</I> actually meant something. The line between the alternative and the mainstream was clearly drawn and choosing side was a choice of identity. Looking back at the time, and skimming through my poor sounding tapes from the broadcasts, it's easy to realise how much fine music I ignored in favor of an endless stream of guitar massacre and spotty, unsexy shoegazers.<BR><BR>To get to the point: I thought this alternative scene was dead and gone a long time ago. But I'm proved wrong. It's alive and well and living in Germany.<BR><BR>The presenter of Bommen would have been proud to air at least ten tracks on </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>IN SEARCH OF A MASTER-IN SEARCH OF A SLAVE - A TRIBUTE TO NICK DRAKE</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, released by bluNoise (whose sublabel Traurige Tropen is responsible for the release of Gilbert Isbin's tribute album earlier this year).<BR><BR>The trademarks are all present: massive walls of detuned guitars, dissonant feedback noise, and young men's nasal voices, usually contemplating the boredom of suburbian life - only in this case, the songs were originally recorded by an upper-class bohemian from the English countryside. <BR><BR>Each band on this album has been given the opportunity to choose their own favorite Nick Drake song. </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>RIVER MAN, PLACE TO BE</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>FROM THE MORNING</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> are featured twice, and </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>MAYFAIR</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is covered for the first time since Millie Small's attempt in the early 70's. Swiss combo Honey For Petzi have, interestingly enough, decided that their favorite Drake tune is the short instrumental piece called </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>HORN</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, here extended to nearly three minutes.<BR><BR>The majority of the songs are taken from the </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>PINK MOON</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> album, which is appropriate enough for the alternative approach. That stripped-down album is full of guitar riffs which can quite effectively be transformed into an electric feedback-festival. The best attempt, in my opinion, is Blackmail's </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>PARASITE</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, although this track shares a common tendency to go on too long, in this case well beyond 5 minutes. Blackmail is described as "maybe the best known German indie-band", and they manage to preserve an unsettling nerve throughout the song. The singer does however sound a bit too indifferent to really crawl under the listener's skin.<BR><BR>Scumbucket, Blimps Go '90, Pendikel, Ulme, Bugs Know Best and Sandycoates (the last mentioned from the U.S.A.) delivers more of the old school indie/hardcore. Sonic Youth, Pixies, Nine Inch Nails and early Alice In Chains, as well as shoegazers like Ride and Swervedriver, are most likely represented in these bands' record collections. </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>BLACK EYED DOG</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> has been covered similarly, but to better effect, by Peter Bruntnell, and I fail to see any point in Blimps Go '90's 5-minute rendition of </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>HARVEST BREED</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, but the rest in this category have come up with  decent cover versions, bar the pathetic spoken lyrics of French band Bugs Know Best's </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>PINK MOON</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>.<BR><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE=1>RIVER MAN</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> in the hands of Pendikel (described as "German trash-hardcore") is not bad at all. I like the switches between acoustic and electric guitars, and the song takes some unexpected turns. It comes out a bit stiff-legged though, while the original's standout quality is very much due to the vague, floating feeling of a song that can't decide if it's in a major or a minor key. <BR><BR>Mumble & Peg (from the U.S.A.) do some interesting things with </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>WHICH WILL</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. It's a disturbing and chilling piece, backed up by dissonant feedback and samplings, that takes the tune to the opposite side of Lucinda Williams' tender camp-fire rendition from 1989. And, here's a singer who sounds like he means every word he sings.<BR><BR>The same must be said about the singer of Swiss band Favez, who tackle </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>SATURDAY SUN</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> in a fine way. A delicate whisper in the midst of all the noise on this album. An after hours sit-in at the smoky jazz cafe on the corner. It's a highlight of the album and it makes me wonder what Nick Cave would be able to do with this song.<BR><BR>The last track on the album is really an odd bird. At first I'm confused: is it Wagner? is it Carmina Burana? Is it a joke? But no, it's just Lude playing </FONT><FONT SIZE=1>WAY TO BLUE</FONT><FONT SIZE=2> as a 7-minute long medieval death mass. Perhaps it gives us a hint how Joy Division would have done it had they been more bombastic. It may sound strange in theory, but it actually works! It's one of the few tracks here that makes me go back to the original and listen to it with fresh ears. The chanteuse is struggling to keep her voice in tune, but it's really the instrumental arrangement that matters here.<BR><BR><BR>Rating: 3 (out of 5)<BR><BR><BR><B>SOME OTHER VOICES:</B><BR><BR>"A monument dedicated to the famous British songwriter " (K&ouml;LNER)" <BR><BR>"The cream of the German Indie-pop meet in order to record their interpretations of  Nick Drake songs.
