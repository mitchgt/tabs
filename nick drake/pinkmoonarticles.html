But the musiciansaren't here to play Sheik's hit, "Barely Breathing." As small candles flicker on each table, lending theclub an altar-like ambience, Sheik and Leonard strum away and begin performing in its entirety<I>Pink Moon,</I> the 1972 album by British cult singer-songwriter Nick Drake.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Not only doesn't the crowd mind, but they hang on to every sylvan chord and lyric. "I've never seen an audience that quiet," Sheik comments later. "They're not that attentive at my <I>own</I> shows."Sheik, who worships the "beautiful simplicity" of Drake's music, is such an admirer that his nextproject will be credited to Phantom Moon, a band name inspired by Drake.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Sheik's concert is only one of many signs of Drake's heightened profile. In recent years he has beenthe subject of a biography as well as tribute concerts in New York and London. His songs have beencovered by Lucinda Williams and Kelly Willis and used in the film <I>Practical Magic.</I> But thosenods pale next to that of Volkswagen, which last November debuted a commercial for its zippy Cabrioconvertible. During the alluring minute-long spot, collegiate-looking kids take a nighttime drivethrough a wooded area on their way to a party, to the accompaniment of the wafting chords and whispery voice of "Pink Moon."<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;The response was instantaneous, particularly from twentysomethings who may have never before heardDrake's timeless goth-folk. <I>Pink Moon,</I> which, according to SoundScan, had been selling between85 and 108 copies in the weeks before, shot up to as many as 1,858 in a single week - not includingthe more than 5,000 copies sold on Amazon.com, which is linked to Volkswagen's website. Drake's1994 anthology <I>Way To Blue</I> saw a similar leap. Capitalizing on the interest, Drake's label, Hannibal, will soon begin pitching "Pink Moon" to radio, followed this summer by the release of remastered versions of Drake's three original albums. Later in the year, the label will bring out  a previously unreleased demo tape recorded in 1967, which has Drake-ites drooling in anticipating.  <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;  Drake himself will not be available for interviews or promotional concerts; he has been dead almost   26 years.   <BR><BR>Ironically, Hannibal head Joe Boyd recalls being less than enthused when he first heard <I>Pink Moon.</I> "I was disappointed," he says of the stark work, "because it wasn't going to make him a star." When it's pointed out that it still might, Boyd chuckles, before turning somber. "It's terribly sad. But  history is full of such figures in a way, like Chatterton and Rimbaud."  <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;The uninitiated may find such claims exaggerated, but Drake cultists have long regarded him as one of rock's most tragically romantic figures. Tall, introverted, and given to wearing black, Drake was a 19-year-old student at Cambridge University when he presented Boyd with a tape of his beautifully placid folk-jazz songs in 1968. During their meeting, Drake was "shy, quiet, and looked at the ground a lot," recalls Boyd, who wound up producing Drake's two first albums: his 1969 debut <I>Five Leaves Left</I> and 1970's <I>Bryter Layter.</I> Both wrapped Drake's silken voice - and his elliptical ruminations on time passages, missed opportunities, rainy days, and the occasional burst of sun - in baroque strings and jazzy piano. The albums sold only a few thousand copies in the U.K., and Drake - who granted only one interview in his lifetime - fell into a prolonged depression over their commercial failure. That angst manifested itself on his third album, the bare-bones <I>Pink Moon.</I> (Legend has it that he left its master tape at his label's reception desk without telling anyone.) In November 1974, Drake's mother, Molly, found her 26-year-old son dead in his bedroom at the family  home in Tanworth-in-Arden, near Birmingham. The autopsy revealed an overdose of antidepressants;  the debate over whether it was suicide still rages.  <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;In death, Drake and his sublime music took on an increasingly new life. Within months, fans began making pilgrimages to the Drake home, and each year his albums have sold in increasing numbers. One recent convert was Shane Hutton, senior copywriter at the Boston ad agency Arnold Communications, who flashed upon the song while helping conceive the Cabrio ad. "We went through a bunch of songs, but that one kept sticking to the wall," he says. "It transports you, and it's difficult to forget once you hear it." VW director of marketing Liz Vanzura says no one at her company had heard of Drake, but she thought the track's "warm-hearted, free-spirited feeling" was a perfect fit. Drake's sister Gabrielle, who runs his estate, gave her blessing, telling Hannibal, "Nick wasn't happy being a cult figure."<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Naturally, the commercial has been greeted warily by the Drake cult. "They say, 'It's terrible,'" Jason Creed, editor of the all-Drake <I>Pynk Moon</I> fanzine, says of the letters he's received. "It has to do with Nick's music being sacred and that this cheapens or devalues the art." Counters Boyd: "I understand these emotions, but it's always been my ambition that Nick's music would be very popular. I wanted to make Nick a star in 1968, and that hasn't changed. I'm committed to taste and respect, but I have no hesitation in saying we're doing our best to maximize the effect of the exposure." (Boyd adds that Drake had a sense of humour and could have afforded a $19-23,000 Cabrio "if he was alive to receive the fees for the use of the track.")<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, everybody finds themselves in the unusual position of grooming a potential hit by a long-deceased act. "The initial pitch will be a funny thing happened on the way to obscurity," says Paul Langton, head of radio promotion at RykoPalm, which owns Hannibal. "I'll have to handle this with kid gloves. I love Nick Drake, but it's weird how these things happen."<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><B>Rolling Stone website <A HREF="http://www.rollingstone.com">rollingstone.com</A> April, 2000</B><BR><BR><BR>Nick Drake's "Pink Moon" is Rising                              Volkswagen ad renews interest in late folk rocker                              In what has to be one of pop music's                              cruelest ironies, cult folk hero Nick                              Drake, who overdosed on                              antidepressants twenty-six years                              ago after releasing three                              commercially disappointing albums,                              is on the verge of scoring his first                              ever chart hit thanks to a Volkswagen                              commercial.                              <BR><BR>                              The television spot for the new Cabrioconvertible,                              which features four attractivestar-gazing youths driving                              to Drake's 1972 song "Pink Moon," hasbeen in rotation                              since last December.

"I lovethings reaching out of                              the past and slightly diluting ourheadlong rush into the                              future," Boyd says. "In a way, maybe thefact that Nick                              wasn't popular at the time made him notof the time."<BR><BR>                              Drake's bohemian influence can be heardin everyone                              from Elliott Smith and Beth Orton toR.E.M and the Cure.                              Interestingly enough, executives atArnold Advertising,                              who developed the concept for the VW ad,titled the spot                              "Milky Way," because they had originallyintended to use                              the Church's "Under the Milky Way" forthe soundtrack.

His 1972 album Pink Moon has shot to number five in thechart of online record sales company Amazon.com after its titlesong was used in an advert for the Cabrio model.<BR><BR>The advert, being shown on US television, has proved so popular thatDrake's track is being launched on American radio next week before itsrelease as a single. The Pink Moon album has shot up the charts behindtitles from N'Sync, Santana, Steely Dan and Macy Gray. Yet during hislifetime it sold fewer than 5,000 copies.<BR><BR>"We're absolutely delighted," said Joe Boyd of Ryko-Palm Pictures,which controls Drake's back catalogue and who also produced his firsttwo albums. "We felt anything that gets Nick's music out to more peopleis good. When I saw the advert I thought it was brilliant." Drake, whowas born in Burma but moved back to Britain when he was seven, died froman apparently accidental overdose of sleeping pills in November, 1974.Throughout his adult life he had suffered from depression and neededpsychiatric help.<BR><BR>Pink Moon was recorded in just two nights with Drake accompanyinghimself on guitar and piano with no band or backing.<BR><BR>Despite his relatively obscure career the singer, brother of formerCrossroads actress Gabrielle Drake, has maintained a cult followingfor his folk-rock style. There are no plans to show the commercial inBritain although Drake's first album, Five Leaves Left, is being re-released this month on vinyl.<BR><BR>Gabrielle, who played Jill Hammond in the long-running soap, saysDrake's death has had a profound effect on her life. "The concept oftragedy and sorrow meant nothing to me until Nick died. Then I was ableto understand other people's tragedies. I was able to cry much moreeasily, which isn't a bad thing. I loved him deeply and always supported<BR><BR>him.Though we went our own way for a time, we grew closer as we grewolder. "He had been in a depressed state for several years and wasundergoing treatment. To that extent what happened wasn'tunexpected."<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>	</TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
