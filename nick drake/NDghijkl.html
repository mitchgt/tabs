We asked him why he wasn't still doing music and he said unless you're Nelson Riddle you can't make a living as a string arranger /.../ We bought him a drink and asked if he's still got the scores he did for Nick's records. He said they're in his mother's potting shed. Then we asked him to work with us. We pumped him for gossip. We asked him if it was true Nick never washed, and he said, 'Well, it was very fashionable to be dirty in those days.'" In the same article, it is also revealed that Kirby is currently doing arrangements for Paul Weller's next album.</FONT><BR><BR><BR>The following list is a modest attempt to put together Robert Kirby's impressive list of qualifications.

He says he doesn'tunderstand the point of living. Every few weeks he will drive to visit Sheilaand John Wood, where he sits silently for hours. At one point Sheila has thecourage to ask provocatively: "If you're so unhappy, Nick, why haven't youkilled yourself?". "It's too cowardly", he replies. <br><br>Once again he can't write music. The actions he now undertakes can in hindsightbe looked upon as quite confused and desperate. He visits an Army recruiter,but doesn't (not surprising) get past an interview. He comes up with an idea ofbecoming a computer programmer and through his father Rodney's assistance he istaken on by a company. But he is for this work sent to London, to stay alone ina hotel room, and he walks right off the job.<br><br>Nick's despair is slowly beginning to turn into anger. He is criticizing hisold friends with different accusations, several concerning money - he can'tunderstand why his royalty checks never grow bigger. That the record sales arepractically close to none. In another fit of anger he turns on his admiredfriend and fellow musician John Martyn, who he accuses for becoming insincereand commercial in his music. He calls him 'devious' and drives away. On the wayhome he rans out of gas and has to walk the remaining miles. When he arrives ata friend's house, he is so upset that he wants to drive back immediately toapologize.<br><br>In 1974, Nick is able to record four final songs (included on 'Time Of NoReply'). When writing the songs, he is morbidly depressed. After therecordings, Nick tells John Wood:<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I can't think of words. I feel no emotion about anything. I don't want tolaugh or cry. I'm numb - dead inside."  (Lubow)</FONT></UL><br>The recording of these four songs leads to preparations of making a fourthalbum. They get into the studio, but Nick has serious problems with his voice.He drastically decides to drop his singing career for ever.<br><br>After making this decision he appears to be cheerful again. He goes to Paris,lives in a house-boat by the Seine and falls in love with this new life socompletely that he takes on a Linguaphone course in French. He still won't makeany more records, but maybe he can write for others. Perhaps for FrancoiseHardy who once asked him to write for her. Then he was too depressed, but maybenow...<br><br>Another idea is presented to Molly. He wants to play the violin. He says hewill be going to London the next day to buy one. Molly is very pleased with herson's new found sparkle and offers him her car. The next morning she hands himher car keys. He looks puzzled at her. "Violin...?". He has no idea of whatshe's talking about... <br><br>In November 25 1974, Nick Drake is found dead in his bed. See <A HREF="NDdef.html#d"">Death.</A><BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=5>Le Mythe de Sisyphe</B><br>The book by Albert Camus which Nick gave his mother Molly a copy of shortlybefore his death in 1974. <BR><BR><BR><FONT SIZE=5>Live performances </B><br>Robert Kirby recalls Nick's early live performances:<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nick sat in the middle, in worn-out jeans and with his guitar resting on hiscrossed legs. Around him, in a half-circle, sat the orchestra, usuallycomsisting of twelve female members playing violins, cello and a single flute.Nick's guitar was perfect in tune, and he always played without a singlemistake. He was very still and shy and far from the type of guy who tells funnyjokes between songs. Most often, however, he got along well <br>with the audience; people could easily see the singer and hear the songs in thediscreet way they were performed. These <br>were, after all, small places, no more than 150-200 people..."<br>(Rasmussen p.37)<br></FONT></UL><br>In 1968, Nick even performs at the May Ball, backed by a dozen female stringplayers dressed in black evening gowns and white feather boas.<br><br>In August 1969, prior to the release of 'Five Leaves Left', Nick records asession for John Peel at the BBC. The existence of tapes from the session isvery uncertain. It seems likely that the tape has been erased. Despiteexhausting research, it has not been located.<br><br>After the release of 'Five Leaves Left' 1969, Nick agrees to support it byperforming. He appears with John and Beverly martin at a packed Royal FestivalHall in London on 24th September 1969, "sitting on a stool, staring at hisshoes, never addressing the audience" (Lubow). Joe Boyd recalls the audience asbeing "quiet and respectful", and calls Nick's performance "brilliant - theaudience {were} mesmerised." (Keep p.71)<br><br><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="bilder/NDad.GIF">Another witness of Nick performing live is David Sandison, at the time a pressagent at Island Records. Sandison, who is in the audience when Nick plays atQueen Elizabeth Hall on 21st February 1970, describes this somewhattragi-comical scene: <br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The first time I ever saw Nick Drake, he came on  with his guitar, sat on astool, looked at the floor and sang a series of muffled songs punctuated bymumbled thanks for the scattering of bewildered applause from the audience whodidn't really know who the hell he was, not cared too much. At the end of hislast song, his guitar was still holding the final notes as he got up, glancedup, then walked off, his shoulders hunched as if to protect him from theembarrassment of actually having to meet people." (quote from Brian Hogg)</FONT></UL><br>The set at Queen Elizabeth hall includes Hazey Jane I and Things Behind TheSun, the latter being included on the 'Pink Moon' LP in 1972<br><br>Later he does a tour of eight college-like venues up north, but it ends up as afailure since the people are more interested in talking, shouting and drinkingthan in listening to a shy, low-voiced singer-songwriter. Eventually, thedisappointment of this tour is enough to make Nick never want to perform liveagain ever.<br><br>Nick's sister Gabrielle has a slightly different view of Nick performing live: <br> <UL><FONT SIZE=2> "It's like I've read reports of his concerts where the audience was supposedly bemused at this person who shuffled on-stage, did his songs and shuffled off apologetically. That was never my impression. I feel he had an absolute charisma and that his audience were were spellbound, and I think I know a little about when an audience is spellbound or not."
