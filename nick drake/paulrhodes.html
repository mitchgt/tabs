Telephone Interview with Patrick Humphries.<BR><BR>I was asked to interview Patrick in connection with a review of <FONT SIZE=2>NICK DRAKE, THE BIOGRAPHY</FONT> to appear in the Yorkshire Evening Press. Patrick was kindenough to speak to me for nearly an hour, but due to my lack of shorthand,I had to scribble everything down as best I could. I therefore accept fullresponsibility for any inaccuracies.<BR><BR></FONT></CENTER><BR><BR><B>Why publish the book now, so long after his death?</B><BR>- Nick Drake's name kept coming up when I was writing theRichard Thompson biography. There is a perennial interest in Nick's music,he is a real fascination for fans and the people who know about him tend tobe obsessive. Most people will give you a blank look when his name ismentioned, although he is also popular in Holland. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- I wrote the book for a fairly specific audience because I felt that theprevious few books and articles about Nick Drake did a disservice to hismusic and memory. There was an awful lot of myth-making and misinformationafter he died, Nick deserves a book more fitting to his memory.The timing of the book's release to coincide with the 23rd anniversary ofhis death is coincidental. Bloomsbury wanted to get the book out beforeChristmas. Releasing the book next year on his 50th anniversary would havebeen too contrived. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Before my book the bulk of the information about Nick came from ArthurLubow's piece in the Fruit Tree box set. While it is a beautifully writtenpiece, there are a lot of gaps. I wanted to tell the story of his shortlife as accurately as possible, so I conducted over 50 interviews for thebook which took two years to write.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- I don't want to blow my own trumpet, but to the best of my knowledge it isan accurate picture of Nick's life by people who knew him. Part of thedifficulty for a biographer is that he said so little. Take the only songabout a known subject, <FONT SIZE=2>THREE HOURS</FONT> about Nick's friend Jeremy Mason fromMarlborough. When Jeremy asked Nick what the song was about, he wouldn'tsay, and this was the song's subject talking to the song's author.<B><BR><BR>Why did John Wood and Joe Boyd refuse to be interviewed?</B><BR>- The reason why Joe wasn't involved is a complicated story. Both he andGabrielle have been approached many times in the past. He told me to go andget a deal, then we'd talk, but it never happened. Getting a book dealabout someone like Nick Drake is difficult. I really admire Bloomsbury fortaking the chance, and in fact they are already reprinting before it iseven published.<BR><B><BR>How did you first discover Nick Drake, what effect did it have on you?</B><BR>- I knew about Nick at the time, I bought <FONT SIZE=2>BRYTER LAYTER</FONT> which I liked verymuch. Today everyone assumes that a release of a Nick Drake record was avery important event. It simply didn't happen that way, Nick was not even afootnote in the music of the day. There was so much going on, Nick wascompeting against lots and lots of astonishing music that has stood thetest of time. There were no singles, no gigs, but I was vaguely aware ofhim. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- It was only after the release of <FONT SIZE=2>FRUIT TREE</FONT> box set five years after hedied that I really got into Nick's work. That was due to my uncle (whodelivered Nick into the world in Burma, 1948), but unfortunately I neverreally got the chance to discuss it with him. These books seem to chooseyou, it wasn't a calculated decision to spend two years of my life writingabout him. His name kept coming up, I interviewed Gabrielle in 1994 and shehad very fond memories of my uncle.<BR><B><BR>What is the continuing appeal of Nick's music? Jeff Buckley said that thecult around the dead artist is ravenous and irrational. How much of Nick'sposthumous acclaim can be attributed to this whole cult around deadartists, often at the expense of the music and the artist's true character?<BR></B>- It surprises me that the work of a very shy, introverted, introspectiveyoung chap still lasts. I could understand his cult lasting 10/15 years,rock n' roll is very good at cult figures. The big surprise is that despitethe internet and many other distractions, Nick is actually flourishing. Itsappeal lies in its timelessness. As Clive Gregson says, the music doesn'tdate itself. Nick didn't release a dodgy concept album. His albums werequiet, introspective and contemplative. Of course he was very good looking,striking to look at, very James Dean. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- REM's Peter Buck deconstructs that whole thing about posthumous myths bysaying that when the guitarist with Chicago died, no-one went out andbought Chicago records. Dave Pegg says that he hears Nick's records andthinks they're great. It really doesn't matter if the person who sings themis dead or alive. In Nick's case, you can see a definite career arc, hewon't disappoint anyone with his new release.<BR><B><BR>Was Nick always the doomed artist?<BR></B>- Even at school, aged 13/14 he was very shy, never the life and soul of theparty. I was able to lend some insight into life in public school as I wentto Dulwich. I remember the impact of Dylan and the Beatles. Americans don'treally understand the class thing, and Nick was very upper class, from avery privileged background. He never tried to deny his upbringing.Researching the book threw up lots of surprises. Arthur Lubow said thatNick hated performing, whereas his Marlborough friends remember Nick at thecentre of things, someone who loved to sing and play. The problems later oncame from the fact that Nick had to perform alone. If he'd had a say, DannyThompson on  bass and a drummer, maybe that would have made a difference. Asinger on stage is the loneliest man in the world - telling his complicatedstories with nowhere to run or hide. The fact that the songs were sopersonal made the audience's rejection doubly hurtful. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- It was such a surprise to find that Nick met the Rolling Stones, or went toJohn Lennon's house. I find that such a striking image, the man witheverything is visited by the man who has nothing. Unfortunately memoriesare dim 30 years after the event, a lot of the kids were a bit pissed orstoned at the events they talked to me about. I hope the book jogs a fewmemories in the same way as the Mojo piece. After that I received a letterfrom an American girl who wrote <FONT SIZE=2>BEEN SMOKING TOO LONG</FONT>, she met Nick inAix in 1967, and had wonderful memories of him.<BR><B><BR>Did anyone really know Nick Drake?<BR></B>- I think his parents knew him, although he did retreat back on himself. Hewas a proud and loyal son to them. His music distanced Nick from hisparents, but that is not uncommon, particularly back then. My parents couldnever understand my devotion to Bob Dylan as long as they lived. Todayparents and children alike listen to Oasis. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- Certainly in later years Nick had what Gabrielle Drake called a negativepresence. Jerry Gilbert, the one man to interview Nick found himmonosyllabic. This was certainly the case when Nick was ill. However, evenwhen well he was still a nervy and shy person. His friends still speak veryfondly of him, and there was always somewhere for him to stay. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- People assume Nick spent his whole time listening to Tim Buckley andLeonard Cohen, that wasn't true. He listened to a wide variety of artists,for example blues from the 1940s, The Steve Miller Band, Davy Graham andZoot Money and the Big Roll Band, which really broadens out our picture ofhim. <FONT SIZE=2>THE BRANDENBURG CONCERTO</FONT> he had on his turntable the night he died issombre music. But Nick bought those records in Aix in 1967, because heliked them, not because he deliberately selected gloomy music. <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- There are many shadowy places in Nick's short life. The trip to Spain andhis last trip to Paris are two big gaps, I came up against a lot of brickwalls.<BR><B><BR>Do you have any more details about Nick's fiancee?<BR></B>- The name of Nick's fiancee came up quite a lot, more so than to just becoincidental. He supposedly met her in London. Nick found it very difficultto communicate, he was very shy. He was on the outside looking in all hislife. However friends at Cambridge describe how he was a magnet for thegirls, and he did go out with Linda Thompson. Whether or not Nick wascapable of sustaining a relationship, who can tell? <BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;- What makes writing about Nick Drake interesting is the contradictions thatabound. Nick determinedly believed in the quality and purity of his music,and was disappointed when it didn't sell. I would like the book to sell100,000 copies but I'm realistic enough to know it is unlikely.<BR><B><BR>You mention the music is frozen in immaturity, despite having girlfriends.Is there not any progression? Even if it is just "The steady progress ofdefeat" as Joe Boyd once put it.<BR></B>- Nick was only very young, 31 tracks is just the beginning of a career. Theyare frozen in immaturity, there is the beginnings of a progression, but notenough. Anthea Joseph, who has worked with many excellentsinger-songwriters, felt there was no development there. It wasparticularly interesting that Robert Kirby recalls guitar figures from <FONT SIZE=2>PINK MOON</FONT> songs being played at Cambridge.<BR><B><BR>Can Nick's songs be covered successfully?<BR></B>- Yes, his songs are not particularly challenging, but they do have lovelymelodies. I can understand how the songs from <FONT SIZE=2>PINK MOON</FONT> might be toodifficult. I don't know anything about a tribute album, there has been talkof one for the past seven years. What makes the songs difficult to cover,is that Nick's life and work are inextricably entwined.<BR><B><BR>Your uncle, James Lusk says that "causes of mental disturbance are usuallymultiple" Was Nick's illness genetic, trauma or drug induced?<BR></B>- Nick certainly suffered from some kind of depression. I do think it isimportant to bear in mind is that Nick died aged 26, but he had led arelatively contented life for 22 or 23 years. No-one really knows the causeof Nick's illness, not Nick's parents, nor Nick himself. He tried todistance himself, he didn't really feel anything or communicate to anyone.Smoking dope exaggerated a reticence that was already there. Nick wasdefinitely not an acid casualty, that is too simplistic, though it may havebeen a factor. All we really know for sure is that Nick had an illness thatdogged his last three years.<BR><B><BR>Tim Buckley once said: "Lose the anger, lose the music" Without Nick'sillness, would there have been anything special about his music?<BR></B>- It is hard to say how much the illness defined Nick's music, there is thatwhole thing of illness being linked with genius. I don't know.It is all part of this cult thing, the endless 'what ifs'. Speculation isjust that, if he'd gone out and gigged... At the time you had to gig to getyour name known. People at Island were like, 'OK Nick's got an album out -where's the single, is he on the road?'. The reviews were kind but by nomeans ecstatic.<BR><B><BR>Do you think there was anything beneath the surface of his outwardly idealfamily life?<BR></B>- I can't really comment on that. What I can say is that everyone said hisparents were wonderful, and really bore the brunt of Nick's corrosiveillness, and did all they could. They were heartbroken when he died, butthe fans who visited them were a real source of comfort. Their son wasignored when he was alive, so to have visitors from half way around theworld calling to see you was so touching for them. It was as if his lifewasn't wasted.<BR><B><BR>People that knew Nick, John Martyn for example, say that he was very awareof his image as a romantic, neglected poet/singer. Do you think he becamethe image, like Joy Division's Ian Curtis?<BR></B>- At the beginning Nick was very image conscious, an image that fittedperfectly with the whole singer-songwriter thing. People assume RichardThompson is permanently miserable, but he gets into character to write hissongs. He really gets beneath the skin of the people he sings about.I don't altogether buy it that the image took him over, it was a depressiveillness Nick suffered from. It doesn't look to be a genetic disorder. Nickwas the only one in the family who suffered, it was a random thing.<BR><B><BR>Nick has a song on a popular soundtrack album, a new biography, a tributeconcert in New York.  Given that there is no footage available, and the TVprogramme failed to find a backer has he peaked?<BR></B>- I couldn't believe it when I saw the track on the Heartbeat album. There heis, at the end along with Jim Croce. Jim's music is still playedoccasionally on Radio Two, but not Nick's.There is a Kaleidoscope programme on Radio Four devoted to Nick Drake,which I think will air on December 20.<BR><B><BR>Will Nick's music continue to be popular?<BR></B>- Nick Drake's appeal is actually increasing. It will continue, and at somepoint Joe and Gabrielle will have to consider putting out the HomeRecordings in some form. There will probably be a television show, theKaleidoscope radio show.<BR><B><BR>So for Nick Drake, it really seems to be a case of brighter later. Did hehave it planned this way?<BR></B>- We will never know, it would have been nice for Nick to have been with usto share it, his parents too. Of course there is still Gabrielle.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>&copy;1997 Paul Rhodes<BR><BR></FONT><I>Paul Rhodes is a 24-year old copywriter and Nick Drake fan from York, England.</I><BR><BR><A HREF="../DRAKE/suellenholland.html">Review of Patrick Humphries' biography</A> | <A HREF="http://www.bloomsbury.com"> Ordering the biography from Bloomsbury</A><BR><BR></BLOCKQUOTE><HR NOSHADE><FONT SIZE=1> Compiled by Mikael Ledin (text + content) and Mats Renvall (graphics)<br></body></html>
