But Nick is not the kind of folk singer whowill drift into your friendly neighbourhood folk club; in fact, if you've seenhim perform, the chances are that it was on the bill of a sell-out FestivalHall concert.</B><BR>	&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week I spoke to Nick, and eventually discovered that it has been preciselythese kind of gigs that had hung him up - the reason why he has shied away frompublic performances almost without exception.<BR>	&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think the problem was with the material, which I wrote rather for recordsthan performing. There were only two or three concerts that felt right, andthere was something wrong with all the others. I did play Cousins and one ortwo folk clubs in the north, but the gigs just sort of petered out," Nickexplained.<BR>	&nbsp;&nbsp;Nick pointed out that he was not happy with the way the gigs were working outand he couldn't get into them properly. Why, then, was he performing at suchesteemed venues as the Festival Hall?<BR>	&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was under some obligation to them, but it wasn't the end of the world when Istopped. If I was enjoying the gigs it would have made much more sense."<br><br>Don't, however, gain the impression that Nick is not a superb artist. Placed inthe right context, his songs produce quite a stunning effect over a period oftime. He has worked on two albums with Witchseason producer Joe Boyd, thelatter having been released only only last week. Entitled "Bryter Layter", itfeatures some of the musicians who contributed to the success of the John andBeverly Martyn albums, notably Paul Harris; and Robert Kirby's arrangements arejust as important as Nick Drake's songs.<BR>	&nbsp;&nbsp;Says Nick: "I had something in mind when I wrote the songs, knowing that theyweren't just for me. The album took a long time to do, in fact, we started italmost a year ago. But I'm not altogether clear about this album - I haven'tgot to terms with the whole presentation."<br><br>What's the next step for Nick? "I think there'll be another album and I havesome material for it, but I'll be looking around now to see if the album leadsanywhere naturally. For the next one I had the idea of just doing somethingwith John Wood, the engineer at Sound Techniques."<BR>	&nbsp;&nbsp;Would there be any gigs to promote the album? "I don't think that would help -unless they were done in the right way. I'm just not very sure at the moment,it's hard to tell what will turn up. If I could find making music a fairlynatural connection with something else, then I might move on to somethingelse."</TABLE><BR><BR><BR><BR><A NAME="FAM"></A><HR SIZE=2> <BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0><TD WIDTH=350><CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><B>Interviews with Gabrielle, <br>Rodney &amp; Molly Drake and JohnWood</B><br>From "Walhalla", <br>a Dutch radio programme originally broadcasted in 1979.<br> Thanks to Perry Moree for this one. </FONT><br><br><br><br><FONT SIZE=5>Childhood</FONT></CENTER><br><B>Gabrielle:</B> We had an exceptionally happy childhood. We were a very close familyand we had parents who were everything that children should have as parents,they were wonderful. We used to have... I mean, they were also quite strict,you know, we were brought up quite strictly, they always made clear for us thatalthough our parents expected us to work hard and everything - that ultimately,decisions in life about what we wanted to do would remain with us. And whateverwe wanted to do, provided we really wanted to do it, they would help us. He wasa bright boy, he went to Cambridge University, but his heart was always inmusic. And when that became obvious to my parents, to my father, they dideverything they could to encourage him and certainly never put any bars in hisway.<br><br><B>Rodney:</B> He didn't seem to be interested in what most boys were interested in,somehow, although he was very good at things. Molly just said that he didn'treally want to be head of things, but the fact of matter was that when he wentto preparing school, he became head boy. Although he didn't really want to be.He was a boy of very good physique, he had a fine figure, and he was captain ofvarious things when he was at his first school. When he went to his nextschool, he became head boy of his first house. But it didn't really seem tomean much to him. There was something else going on in his mind all the time.And I remember in one of his reports towards the end of the time at his firstschool, the headmaster gave him a very good report, but said at the end thatnone of us seemed to know him very well. And I think that was it. All the waythrough with Nick. People didn't know him very much. And I think it beganwith...?..., he seemed to be so very interested in music that it was reallymusic that was interesting him. And he did once say to me, much later in life:"There's music running through my head all the time". And I think in a way itstarted when he was very young, don't you?<br><br><B>Molly:</B> Oh yes. I think it did. <br><br><B>Gabrielle:</B> Nick was very obstinate as a little boy. He knew absolutely what hewanted, always. He was much quiter than I was in many ways. I think Nick wasboth a loner and a leader, I mean certainly at school. Whereas I would be afollower and seek friends, Nick would go off on his own and people would followhim. He'd definitely be a leader. <br>   Nick never shouted. If Nick shouted it was really bad, he was deeply upset.I think it would take a lot to make Nick angry and then when he was he wouldn'tbe able to get over it quickly. And I think he found it difficult in some waysto separate his aggression from his hostility.<br><br><br><br><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Five Leaves Left</FONT></CENTER><BR><B>Molly:</B> He didn't sort of fit very much into the life of the university, but hedid fairly well. He passed the first half of his exams and then 'Five LeavesLeft' came out, and also this booking at Festival Hall. And he felt that he wason the verge of doing what he really truly wanted to do. I mean, he wanted togo to Cambridge, he was quite happy there and he worked very hard, but thatwasn't the real thing in his life. And I think he decided: "Well, I'm going tomiss it, if I go on staying at Cambridge...", and then he only had another ninemonths to get his degree, but he felt  "If I stay  on and carry on with thisand get my degree I'm just going to miss my place in this other race", and hefelt he got to leave Cambridge now, the university then, and concentrate on hismusic.<br><br><B>Rodney:</B> As you can imagine, both of us were very keen on him staying atCambridge. I remember writing him long letters, pointing out the disadvantagesof going away from Cambridge. I remember one expression I used was that adegree was a safety net, and whatever else you do in life, if you manage to geta degree, at least you have something to fall back on. His reply to that wasthat a safety net was the one thing he did not want. So that kind of cut theground from under my feet. We thought - good heavens, if he is good as allthat, his music, which obviously he was, perhaps we're wrong and putting toomuch pressure on him to stay at Cambridge. Perhaps his decision was the rightone. It did however seem an awful pity to us and I'm not at all sure he didn'tregret it in some ways, afterwards. He used to look back on the  Cambridge dayswith a certain amount of nostalgia, but anyway... that's another story.<br><br><br><br><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Bryter Layter</FONT></CENTER><BR><B>Molly:</B> He just had one pair of shoes, which was completely worn out. Hewouldn't have anything different. He wanted to be totally without materialpossessions at all, I think. This was a very bad time. He once said to me thateverything started to go wrong from the Hampstead time on, and I think that waswhen things started to go wrong.<br><br><B>John Wood:</B> 'Bryter Layter', for me, I think in a lot of ways is the mostsatisfactory record I've ever worked on. Usually when you make a record there'ssomething you think: Well, I'd like to go back, I'd like to re-mix that or itis a shame we didn't use such and such a musician or... it's a shame thiswasn't better or... and there's nothing on 'Bryter Layter' that I'll ever wantto do again or replace, and that is the only record I think I've ever workedon, that I feel like that about. <br>   When you make records and you expect people to see you and to go to yourconcerts, or to buy records really... Once you committ yourself to makingrecords, then you vommitt yourself to appear in public. And on the basis ofthree records Nick's had an enormous reputation. Although he's not beingfamous, he is very much a cult hero. And the records that he made  have had anenormous following, out of proportin of what they should have, for somebody whodidn't really want to know the rest of the job of being a performer. I thinkhe's had an incredible amount of recognition. Most people, to have therecognition that he has, would have to go out and work day after day, weekafter week, go on the road, and he never did any of that. So I think he's hadmore than his fair share of recognition, really. I think basically, he just wasshy...<br><br><B>Molly:</B> I don't think he wanted to be a star and I don't honestly think he wasthe least interested in money. But: I think he had this feeling that he'd gotsomething to say, to the people of his own generation. He desperately wanted tocommunicate with them, feeling that he could make them happier, that he couldmake things better for them, and he didn't feel that he did that.<br><br><B>Rodney:</B> I'm sure that's right.<br><br><B>Molly:</B> He said to me once: "I have failed in everything I have tried to do". Isaid, oh Nick, how can you... and then I alleviated all the things that he hadso painly done. It didn't make a difference. He had failed to get through tothe people that he wanted to talk to. <br>   He said once: "I don't like it at home, but I can't bear it anywhere else.That was the sort of state he was in. I think he felt it was a kind of refuge,he had to come back here. He tried many times to go away, often, and used tostay away sometimes for several nights and we never knew where he was. We usedto ring up his friends and wonder if they'd seen Nick. In cas he was introuble, you know. I think he had rejected the world. Nothing made him happy.<br><br><br><br><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Pink Moon</FONT></CENTER><BR><B>John Wood:</B> The most startling conversation I ever had with him was when we weremaking 'Pink Moon'. And as you've probably read we made the record in, I think,two evenings. Nick was determined to make a record that was very stark, thatwould have all the texture and cotton wall and sort of tinsel, that had been onthe other two, pulled away. So it was only just him. And he would sit in thecontrol room and sort of blankly look on the wall, and say: "Well, I reallydon't want to hear anything else, I really think people should only just beaware of me and how I am. And the record shouldn't have any sort of tinsel".That wasn't the word he used, I can't remember excactly how he described it. Hewas very determined to make this very stark, bare record and he definitelywanted it to be him more than anything. And I think, in some ways, 'Pink Moon'is probably more like Nick is than the other two records.<br><br><B>Rodney:</B> He went to John Wood and spent a day or two with him in the recordingstudio, and this tape of 'Pink Moon' was produced. And he found it verydifficult to communicate with people by this time. Apparently he went along toIsland and just went to the girl at the desk board and said: "Oh, this is mything, I'm Nick Drake", you know and shoved the tape down and I think she putit in a drawer or something, and they didn't realize what it was for a time.And a week later she said to somebody, "oh, a fellow called Nick Drake came andproduced this thing" and they said "good heavens, let's have a look at it" andit was 'Pink Moon'. <i>(laughter) </i>He didn't stop to see it got into theright hands or anything else about it. And they didn't know where he was or howto get in touch with him, all they had was that tape and they produced therecord.<br><br><br><br><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Death</FONT></CENTER><BR><B>Molly:</B> He went up to bed rather early. I remember him standing at that door,and I said to him, "Are you off to bed, Nick?". I can just see him now, 'causethat's the last time I ever saw him alive. And that was it, and the nextmorning... He often didn't get up at all early, he sometimes had very badnights and I never used to disturb him at all, but it was about, as it sayshere, about 12 o'clock, and I went in, because really it seemed it was time hegot up, and he was lying across the bed. The first thing I saw was his long,long legs...<br><br><B>Rodney:</B> Apparently he'd been down during the night, he'd been downstairs duringthe night, and had some cornflakes or something like that. And he often didthat as a matter of fact, when he couldn't sleep. He often used to godownstairs. More often than not, Molly would hear him passing our bedroom doorand she'd get up, put a dressing gown on, go down and talk to him. Thisoccasion, she didn't hear him. And he went back and he took an extra strongdose of these pills that had been prescribed for him, called Tryptizol, whichhe thought were anti-depressants. He told us he was supposed to take three aday or something. We were always worried about Nick being so depressed. We usedto hide away the aspirin and pills and things like that. These particularthings we didn't think were in any way dangerous.<br><br><B>Molly:</B> He was just having a rotten night.<br><br><B>Rodney:</B> A rotten night and he said "to hell with it" and he took the whole lotof them, and I'm told now that they are dangerous to the heart and so on. Andobviously, it was more than he could take. And it killed him. But there weremany times before, that we would have been much more worried about Nick, doingsomething of that sort than we were at this particular time, that's theextrordinary thing about it. </TABLE><br><br><br><A NAME="KIRBY"></A><br><HR SIZE=2> <BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0><TD WIDTH=350><CENTER><FONT SIZE=2><B>Robert Kirby</B> <BR>interviewed on Swedish radio <BR>- date unknown.<BR>Transcribed from 'Pink Moon'. <BR>Thanks to Jason Creed.</CENTER></FONT><br><br><br><br><B>Interviewer:</B> And he came into the room, and that was the first time you met him? <BR><B>Robert:</B> Yes <BR><B>Int:</B> And you didn't know each other before, you hadn't heard of him? <BR><B>Rob:</B> No <BR><B>Int:</B> And what did he ask you to do? <BR><B>Rob:</B> He asked me if I would write arrangements for WAY TO BLUE, THE THOUGHTS OF MARY JANE and DAY IS DONE, and one song which isn't on any of the LPs, but which we used to do live, called TIME OF NO REPLY. I think I have a tape of it somewhere, but not here. But we used to do that live, the four songs. We used to do concerts, about one a week, one a fortnight, college balls and dances and things. We would be the act between the rock groups, and we would do four songs with the orchestra. Then the orchestra would do one or two classical pieces, and then Nick would do four or five pieces on his own. <BR><B>Int:</B> And that was those four or five pieces? <BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes <BR><B>Int:</B> How did Nick get along with his audience? <BR><B>Rob:</B> He was always very, very quiet. Very shy. I wouldn't say nervous, because he always performed well, and usually if people are nervous they perform badly. It was more, he was just quite retiring you know, shy, but he got on well with them, yes. I mean he quite enjoyed what we were doing. Enjoyed playing. Those were small audiences, maybe one hundred, one hundred and fifty, two hundred, something like that.<BR><B>Int:</B> Because in the ? article there's a great lot of the bad communication between Nick and his audience, and how much it really bothered him.<BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes. I think things like the Queen Elizabeth Hall concert, I was at that one, and I think he was nervous of a big audience. But, again, I didn't really see much lack of communication in that he performed very well, and the audience liked what he did. O.K, he didn't sort of tell jokes and talk between songs, but he got down to the job and played and sung his songs well.<BR><B>Int:</B> And then he asked you to arrange FIVE LEAVES LEFT?<BR><B>Rob:</B> This was later in the year when Tyger Hutchings, who was in the Fairport Convention as bass player, he had heard Nick playing and recommended him to Joe Boyd. So Joe got together making an album, and I think they had already been in with another arranger, and it didn't work out. So Nick said,  "Why don't we try these arrangements that we've already got from this friend of mine?"  So I went up to London from Cambridge, and we recorded them.<BR><B>Int:</B> I heard there was some trouble with the arrangements.<BR><B>Rob:</B> Well this was this first arranger I think they'd got. another person, and those arrangements didn't work out. So they didn't use his and re-did it again with my arrangements. And it worked, I think.<BR><B>Int:</B> Yeah. Is that the thing about when you worked together with Nick, when he titled the album?<BR><B>Rob:</B> FIVE LEAVES LEFT?<BR><B>Int:</B> How did that happen?<BR><B>Rob:</B> Well, he was pressured. They needed the title quickly, you know, the LP was finished, and the artwork was done. In little packets of cigarette papers, Rizla cigarette papers, when you get towards the end of the packet, it says 'FIVE LEAVES LEFT', five leaves of paper, and Nick chose that as the title.<BR><B>Int:</B> Why?<BR><B>Rob:</B> I think because it has a sort of autumnal ring about it, leaves, and the end of autumn. But, at the same time, a certain kind of person who used those cigarette papers would know what it was about. It was a bit of an in-joke. And the same as the second album BRYTER LAYTER.<BR>Nick again couldn't think of a title, and in England, the shipping forecast, or the weather forecast, on the radio, they always say, Stormy with rain, but brighter later. And that's how the title came about. It's just a phrase which is always on the weather forecast, brighter later, but Nick spelt it differently with the Y's <BR><B>Int:</B> Why? <BR><B>Rob:</B> I don't really know actually why. It looks a bit more Olde English, a bit more poetic, that's possibly why. <BR><B>Int:</B> You were the arranger on the numbers on Bryter Layter. <BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes, not all the numbers. I did four numbers, and the overture, the orchestral overture at the beginning of one side, and John Cale did NORTHERN SKY <BR><B>Int:</B> You used one year to produce it.<BR><B>Rob:</B> What, Bryter Layter you mean? <BR><B>Int:</B> Yes. Was it difficult? <BR><B>Rob:</B> Well, I didn't really see much of that. I was called in when they'd got all of the rhythm tracks done, and this was one of the last things to be done, the putting on of strings, and the flutes. And the girls on POOR BOY, I did that. And the backing brass on POOR BOY, but this was all towards the end. There's a mis-print on the sleeve, it says, 'All string and bass arrangements by Robert Kirby,' and it should be string and brass arrangements. That always upset me that, because Dave Pegg, the bass player, is perfectly capable of playing on his own. But I was called in at the end, I didn't know they'd been doing this album for quite a few months before. I really was just called in at the end to put on those arrangements on those tracks that I did. <BR><B>Int:</B> Yes. How was Nick working together with? <BR><B>Rob:</B> I always found him easy to work with. I've done about forty or fifty LPs now, in the last ten years, and still I've not met anyone whose music I respect as much as Nick's. I still think he was the greatest acoustic guitarist to come out of England, and the greatest lyric writer. OK, some people might say his voice was weak, but there again, his songs don't need to be sung by a singer. They need to be sung like someone reading poetry, and that's how he does it. I think he was the most all-round perfect artist I've ever worked with. And I found him very easy to work with, he gave me quite a free hand. He gave me a song like, say FRUIT TREE, on the first LP. He came round one day, played it, and I taped it onto my tape recorder. He said that he possibly heard oboes on it, and strings, and that was about it. I used to then sit with him and go through excactly how he played his chords, because he always de-tuned his guitar. He used strange tunings, not proper guitar tunings, and not the ones like people use in D tunings. He had very complicated tunings. Very complicated. Sometimes a low string would be higher than the string above. And so it would be very important for me to write down exactely how he played each chord, and every bar. And I would do that with him, that sometimes annoyed him I think, because it took a long time. But I had to do it. And then he'd go away and leave me to do the arrangement how I wanted it. And he was very easy to work with. <BR><B>Int:</B> And the strange tunings is an explanation that it's so difficult to play his songs? <BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes. But I think Pink Moon, the last album, which is in fact my favourite, as far as the songs are concerned. If you listen to the guitar playing on some of those songs, I'd challenge anyone to play them, because you've got to crack what the tuning is to start with. <BR><B>Int:</B> Yes. When you travelled together with him at first, you got an impression of him as a person. Was he a lot depressed at that time? <BR><B>Rob:</B> He was always quiet, and he was frequently depressed. But I think a lot of us are depressed quite frequently. I think, quite often, too much is made of this by a lot of people. Or it is as far as I'm concerned, because I saw Nick quite happy many times, you know, we would go to pubs, we would go out and enjoy ourselves. But, there again, sometimes he would come round and not say anything, he'd sort of sit quietly and not say anything, but I just took this as he didn't have anything to say. Maybe he was depressed. Yes, of course he was depressed. But a lot of people have an image of him as being somehow abnormal, distant, he wasn't, he was perfectly easy to be friends with. One could talk to him, have a conversation, do what you would do with anybody else.<BR><B>Int:</B> The last year too?<BR><B>Rob:</B> I didn't see much of him the last year. The news of his death came as a shock. I hadn't seen him for about eight months. I think he had spent a lot of time at home with his parents, and in France. I hadn't seen much of him, and it did come as a shock, because when I'd seen him about eight or nine months before his death he'd been a lot better than he'd been, say three years before that. I think maybe his worst period of depression, that I saw, was maybe two years after Cambridge. Some time before he died. <BR><B>Int:</B> He wrote the music to Bryter Layter in a village? I think it was Hampstead. <BR><B>Rob:</B> He was living in a flat on Havestock Hill then, which is gone now, it's been demolished. A very big gothic, Victorian house. Yes, I went round there quite often and visited him. Yes, in Hampstead it was. <BR><B>Int:</B> Did you see how he worked with his songs, did he work very intense? <BR><B>Rob:</B> I never saw him in the process of actually writing a song. Whenever I heard a song it was finished. But I think it probably took him a long time to write, yes I do. I think he would probably come up with a tuning and a mood on a guitar first, or maybe at the same time as he had an idea as to what the lyric was to be about. This is the way I would think he wrote them, but it's just merely guess work. And then I would think once he got the support pattern on the guitar, he would then know what kind of lyric he could write. <BR><B>Int:</B> How serious did he take it? Did he talk about his songs? <BR><B>Rob:</B> What do you mean? About what the songs were about? <BR><B>Int:</B> Yes. <BR><B>Rob:</B> Never in great depth, in fact no. He seemed to leave it to yourself to work out what you thought they meant. This is another thing, on Pink Moon a lot of people think this is a very depressing, down LP. Yet I find it's got some of the most optimistic songs of his. Such as HARVEST BREED. It's very depressing - Falling fast and falling free/You look to find a friend/Falling fast and falling free. This could just be the end - and then he says - But you're ready now for the harvest breed - which could possibly be about death, but you're ready now for it. It means one is ready for ones environment, one knows what is coming. <BR><B>Int:</B> What is Pink Moon? <BR><B>Rob:</B> I don't know. I don't actually know what Pink Moon means. <BR><B>Int:</B> It's gonna get ye all - I can think of one explanation. <BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes? What do you think? <BR><B>Int:</B> Death. <BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes. <BR><B>Int:</B> It's a kind of symbol for death. <BR><B>Rob:</B> Right, yes, I can see that. <BR><B>Int:</B> None of you stand so tall/pink moon's gonna get ye all - The only thing that's gonna get us all is death <BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes, that's possible. <BR><B>Int:</B> But it's experienced as something not entirely negative. <BR><B>Rob:</B> Right. That's how I see it. It's quite a positive interpretation of it. <BR><B>Int:</B> But I read something about that. He was deeply depressed those two days, when he recorded that album. Do you know something about that? <BR><B>Rob:</B> No I don't in fact. The only person who would know something about that is John Wood. Because I think Nick just turned up, said, "I've got an album to do", and did it in two days. I wasn't there, I knew nothing of it. I'd heard THINGS BEHIND THE SUN, he had that written for some time. That was written before Bryter Layter, because he performed that at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in his set, and which is strange when you think that that's possibly the high-spot of the Pink Moon album, I think. <BR><B>Int:</B> The love songs that came before, do you know anything about that? <BR><B>Rob:</B> Yes, there were several love songs that weren't ever recorded.
