The heavens have opened  up in a downpour thatonly someone from Vancouver could imagine. The theatre  is an old church,now a  venerable local tradition in the world of  music. The crowd is mixed.Young  (could they really know of Nick?), old  (jeez they must have beenadults when  Nick was a lad), rich and poor.  Long hair, tattoos, businesssuits, jeans. Music  is a great leveler,  but could all these peoplepossibly have an obscure folk  singer in  common?<BR><BR>The theatre fills up. There is a soft hum of voices, but  nothingboisterous,  nothing loud. The lights fade and for a brief time  we are alltransformed into  one living breathing organism hanging on  every sound,breathless with every  verse, sighing with every familiar  phrase. Poor Boy- A Tribute to Nick Drake is  not a collection of  imitators or sycophants.This is an evening of appreciation.  After all,  everyone in the hall musthave at least one recording, why would we want  to  hear a poor imitation ofwhat we all love?<BR><BR>The  artists run the gamut from players in neo-punk bands to  avant-gardejazz,  straight folk to musique actuelle. Some like Robin  Holcomb and KateHammett-Vaughan are well regarded recording artists, sharing  their immensetalent because this is important music. Others like Veda Hille  and IanMoore are rising stars that have learned from and been inspired by  Nick andstill others like Alexander Varty and Mark Spybey have come to  express anew vision of Nick's music. Some of these interpretations are far  from thefamiliar, some are like comfortable friends, but all are presented  withlove and respect.<BR><BR>Jazz, folk, rock, free-form and  electro-acoustic sound waves. The geniushas no bounds. Mark Spybey, formerly  of Zoviet France, says it best in hisprogramme note: "I'm not interested in  attempting to create a version ofthis song that bleeds honourably of the  original. That would be an exercisein futility for me and very probably an  insult to Drake's craft." Noinsults, no futility. Just an evening of beauty,  honesty, and wonder.<BR><BR>For me the highlight was the final act of  Alexander Varty, Mark Spybey andguest Ian Moore performing Black Eyed Dog.  Haunting John Martyn-esqueechoplex, intense, soaring vocal melismas and  electronic sounds so etherealand uncanny, it's as if Nick is playing for us  from the other side.<BR><BR>Could it really be five hours later and  can't the show just go on a littlelonger? But no, the lights grow stronger,  the crowd shuffles silentlytowards  the door. No words, no laughter.  Just the occasional sigh, and anambience of  contentment and happiness.  We have all shared something veryspecial tonight. We  all silently  mourn the passing of genius and rejoicethat our lives are a little   richer for knowing.<BR><BR>Thank you Tony. Thank you  Nick.<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><B>Poor Boy: A Tribute to Nick Drake<BR>                                Reviewed by Janet Noade</B><BR><BR>  &nbsp; &nbsp;     <B>fan</B>  <I>n.</I>derived from Fanaticism--excessive enthusiasm or support<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Back in 1985 I thought I saw the spirit of Nick Drake. I had recentlywritten my own song paying tribute to the kind of love I had foundthrough Drake's music. One which saw me enamored with a ghost, anxiouslyawaiting my death so that I could be united with my happily-ever-after.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        I was in Halifax, walking home in the wee hours and clearly beingfollowed. As I approached a particularly darkened residential area, Iquickened my pace only to hear his footsteps hasten too. He came rightup behind me and said, "um...excuse me..?"<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        I sent the Nick doppelganger away, thinking he was a pervert like anyother, but not before I scared the bejeezus out of him. As I was tellinghim off I took a close look, and realized he was the spitting image ofthe dead musician I professed to have communion with. His manner waseven how I'd imagined Nick's would be in life. He was tall and slight,shy and nervous. He had black stuff all over his hands as he broughtthem up to his face in surprise. He apologized and started runningbefore you could say "undead." In a moment of sheer stupidity I foundmyself chasing after the Nick-a-like to find out what he had wanted tosay to me, but I never saw him again.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        I was indeed a fan.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        So all these years later, I was stunned and very pleasantly surprisedto find that the Van East Cultural Centre was hosting a tribute to thisbeautiful soul, whose short life ended 25 years ago this November.Stunned because I didn't realize there were enough ND fans in Vancouverto warrant such an event. I was skeptical when the gig's organizer, TonyReif, told me the concert would probably sell out. That it did.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        As I listened to snippets of conversation from the crowd I realizedthat the cult of Nick Drake was like any other. Certainly it was aboutthe music, but it was also about who knew, who was in the Club. Ioverheard many talking about how they "discovered" Nick, for untilrecently you had to "discover" him. He lived and died in relativeobscurity, yet his music has come to people in all kinds of wonderful ways.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        The Cultch tribute saw twenty-six musicians in varying permutationsonstage and there was a laid back sense to the affair; one set walkedoff while the next walked on. Some musicians spoke to the audience,others simply set up and communicated in song. Many performed their owncompositions dedicated to Drake's memory. Most preferred interpretationsof his songs as opposed to simple emulation.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Unfortunately, the first half of the concert was two and half hourswithout a break and some guests left at the intermission. I was one ofthem. My date and I were too tired and too cranky from sitting in toostiff chairs.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Of what I did see, the high point was definitely Daniel Lapp who playedalmost every instrument in the house and sang with a gentle voicereminiscent of Drake himself. Lapp was the least self-conscious and themost humble of all the performers. When his guitar strap let loose atthe beginning of River Man he handled it with grace and it felt asthough the audience gave him a collective hug.  The low point for me wasKate Hammett-Vaughan's over-the-top version of Poor Boy, and it wasonly during the last song in her set, Clothes Of Sand, that she seemedto settle into the essence of the event.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        I would like to have seen the second half of the show which includedTime Waits, Kathleen Yearwood and Veda Hille but it wasn't to be.Somehow fitting. Waiting fifteen years to find Nick, I miss him again.<BR><BR><HR><BR><BR><B>Poor Boy: A Tribute to Nick Drake<BR>Reviewed by Doretta Lau</B><BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp; Some of Vancouver's finest musicians were out for the Nick Drake tribute. The evening opened with Mark Szabo, Carl Newman and Daniel Bejar, doing their take on Drake's music. Part folk, part indie-rock, the boys had style. They got the crowd into an early applause-happy state.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;CITR [University of B.C.'s FM station, ed. note] favourite Veda Hille, an East Vancouver resident, was also in the line-up. Hille's set, which included the songs Road and Which Will, and her own composition Boy In The Woods, was a highlight of the evening. She jokingly remarked that "her life had reached a pinnacle" because singer-songwriter and pianist Robin Holcomb had done her dishes that morning. Holcomb, who travelled to Vancouver to perform at the tribute, played earlier in the evening. Her combination of singing, spoken word and playing had the crowd's complete attention.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Kate Hammett-Vaughan, known for her strong interpretations of jazz standards, sang Drake's songs beautifully. Her stage presence was a welcomed break from other performers who seemed to be from the Nick Drake school of performance, that is, anti-performance. Many of the musicians, though seasoned, failed to connect with the crowd. Some of the post-rock Tortoise-esque improvisations by musicians lasted over ten minutes in length and were tributes to the musicians' own virtuoso talents rather than to the music of Nick Drake.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Kathleen Yearwood, however, did not have this problem of digression or inability to draw the crowd in. She talked about alienation and the life of Nick Drake, and sang a haunting composition of her own, entitled Read My Diary. She apologised to the sound guy for being rude in soundcheck because she had been "high on painkillers".<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Five hours and a smaller audience later, it seemed that maybe there can be too much of a good thing. With thirteen sets of roughly four songs each, the evening, though set to a beautiful soundtrack, at times wore on. But kudos to Songlines for bringing together a large group of immense talent to give Vancouver a good dose of Nick Drake.<BR><BR><BR><HR NO SHADE><BR><CENTER><B>T H E &nbsp; S E T L I S T</CENTER></B><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2"><B>Mark Szabo (electric guitar), Carl Newman (acoustic guitar), and DanielBejar (keyboard), and all vocals, with Max Lee, drums<BR><BR></B>Fly (Carl, lead vocal)<BR>At the Chime of a City Clock  (Carl and Mark, vocals)<BR>Free Ride (Mark, vocal)<BR>Hazey Jane II (ensemble)<BR><BR><BR><B>Julie Vik (vocals, acoustic guitar+), with Steve Fisk (electric guitar),Simon Fisk (double bass), Peggy Lee (cello)</B>*<B>, and Alexander Varty (electricguitar)+</B><BR><BR>Cello Song (arr: Steve Fisk)*<BR>Three Hours (arr: Steve Fisk)<BR>One of These Things First+ (Julie and Alex, duo)<BR><BR><BR><B>Tony Wilson (electric guitar, arrangements), with Francois Houle (clarinet,bass clarinet), Daniel Lapp (violin, trumpet, vocal</B>*<B>), and Peggy Lee (cello)<BR><BR></B>For Nick (comp: T.
