I was (and still am) a singer and songwriter. At that time I was singing folk songs and originals in a cabaret in Aix with a partner, Jon Sundell. Nick Drake came to see us at the Club De La Tartane sometime in the winter of '66-'67. He contacted me through a friend and asked if I would like to get together to play some songs. One evening we met in a dormitory room at the Universit&eacute; Aix-Marseilles where we sang late into the night. Among the songs I played for him was one called <FONT SIZE=2>BEEN SMOKIN' TOO LONG</FONT> which I had written. I wish I could remember which songs he played for me but I can't. All I remember was his beautiful voice - intense, quiet, and honest. I fell in love with him that night but was too insecure to ever tell him. <BR><BR>After that, he would sometimes come by my flat late at night and we would sing for each other. I don't recall him singing any original songs. He may have been writing then but didn't feel ready to share any with me. I don't know. He was doing songs by Bob Dylan, Bert Jansch, and other contemporary songwriters. I remember singing a song called <FONT SIZE=2>CHANGES</FONT>, written by Phil Ochs, that he liked a lot. <BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>Sit by my side<BR>Come as close as the air<BR>Share in a memory of grey<BR>Wander through my words<BR>And dream about the pictures that I play<BR>Of changes. 	<BR><BR>(from <FONT SIZE=1>CHANGES</FONT> by Phil Ochs)</FONT><BR><BR>I got the feeling Nick was absorbing everything around him - music, lyrics, sights, sounds, people - quietly taking it all in. Although he was shy and reserved, he had a powerful presence that seemed to draw people to him. <BR><BR>Certainly he was physically beautiful and that, plus his natural quietness, made it easy to embroider a tapestry of fantasies around him. Baudelaire, Rimbaud, that whole "Po&egravetes Maudits" thing. This was the south of France, after all, and we were writers and singers roaming ancient streets where Cezanne painted and Rimbaud died. I was already quite good at imagining myself to be all kinds of people I wasn't. So it was a simple matter to envelop Nick in the dark halo of Baudelaire. I'm not sure how much he himself played this role. More than a little, as I recall. <BR><BR>The real "Po&egravetes Maudits" were exquisite writers but, as a general rule, not very nice people. And they had miserable relationships! So I was expecting the worst. (That's my excuse, anyway.) One evening, before he left for North Africa, Nick asked me to meet him at a cafe and then never showed up. I was furious. And hurt. I wrote a song that was one part anger and two parts victim. It was called <FONT SIZE=2>SANDY GREY</FONT>. Then I left and went to Greece. Perhaps I overreacted just a bit. <BR><BR>I never saw Nick again. But that summer I hitchhiked to London (with Bridget St. John)  where I met John Martyn. He recorded <FONT SIZE=2>SANDY GREY</FONT> on his first album, <FONT SIZE=2>LONDON CONVERSATION</FONT>. This was in the summer of 1967 and I don't think John had met Nick yet, or if he had I wasn't aware of it. I never told John who the song was written for, so I'm sure Nick never knew. <BR><BR>Nick did turn up in my life one more time after that. In 1992. I was finishing my own album, <FONT SIZE=2>HOW FAR? HOW FAST?</FONT>  for Higher Octave Music. It was through one of the owners of Higher Octave that I learned about the <FONT SIZE=2>TIME OF NO REPLY</FONT> album. I was listening to it in my studio in Malibu when I heard <FONT SIZE=2>BEEN SMOKIN' TOO LONG</FONT>, a song I had completely forgotten. It was the strangest feeling - confusing, really - to hear Nick singing a song that I felt sure was in some way connected to me. It wasn't till he got to a line where he had changed the words that I realized it was my own song. I clearly remembered writing a different line, not the one he sang, in a book. Later, I found my hand-written lyrics in the notebook I kept while I lived in France. <BR><BR>As I listened to Nick singing my song that day, I was aware he had recorded it in 1967 and I was hearing it twenty-five years later. But somehow the years had turned into hours. Or a short distance I could almost reach across. As if Time had twisted a little and become Space, and I was standing on a bridge between "then" and "now." There must be some law of physics that covers this, maybe Einstein's lost Theory of Emotional Relativity. <BR><BR>I am and always have been a dedicated Romantic. Like many poets and artists, I was drawn to the dark side of romanticism. For years I wrote from a place of sadness and despair, as Nick mostly did. I don't know why some people survive that place while others, like Nick, are pulled deeper into darkness. Depression is an illness we still know little about though there are some effective treatments for it now. In the 1980's I lived for five years with a man whose bouts of depression ultimately led to suicide. I did all I could to help him but his pain was beyond my reach. I gained a much better understanding of what he was going through when I read William Styron's book <FONT SIZE=2>DARKNESS VISIBLE</FONT>, a beautifully written and frightening account of his own struggle with depression.<BR><BR>When I listen to Nick's music, especially the <FONT SIZE=2>PINK MOON</FONT> album, I wish I could really cross that bridge, the one between "then" and "now." I wish I could go back and sing for him one more time. I want to play him the songs I write now, so different from the ones I wrote then. And I want to thank him for writing <FONT SIZE=2>FROM THE MORNING</FONT> and that really nice key change into the chorus of <FONT SIZE=2>THINGS BEHIND THE SUN</FONT>. And, although I know it wouldn't have made a difference in how things turned out, I want to tell him I loved him. Somehow, in some way, I know this can happen. Love is never really lost, and, if we let go, all things come back to us again.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2>Like leaves adrift sometimes we part<BR>But we must trust in the river<BR>If we let her take us by the heart<BR>We will reach the shore together<BR>Time is on our side<BR>Love will survive.	<BR> <BR>(from <FONT SIZE=1>TIME IS ON OUR SIDE</FONT> by Robin Frederick)<BR><BR><BR></FONT>&copy; 1997 Robin Frederick<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=2> A note: The biography of Nick Drake written by Patrick Humphries went to press three days before Patrick learned that I was the author of the song <FONT SIZE=2>BEEN SMOKIN' TOO LONG</FONT>. In the book, he refers to it as a traditional blues song, which it is not. We had a wonderful talk and he will try to correct the information if an American edition is brought out. In the <FONT SIZE=2>FRUIT TREE</FONT> box set the liner notes say something like "...written by a friend of Nick's. We don't know who." I was surprised they had that much information and glad they chose to include it. It does sound like a traditional blues. At that time I was imagining myself to be Memphis Minnie.<BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT>The February 1999 issue of MOJO featured an article by Robin Frederick, called <FONT SIZE=2>TRULY. MADLY.
