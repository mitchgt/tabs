It's also the title track of that album. <br><br>See <A HREF="NDm_z.html#reviews">Reviews</A> for contemporary  reviews of 'Pink Moon'.<br><br><br><FONT SIZE=5>Pink moon - the story - 1970-72</FONT><br> Soon after the release of Bryter Layter, Joe Boyd sells Witchseason to Island Records' owner Chris Blackwell and moves to Los Angeles to work for Warner Brothers. In England, Nick's health condition is getting worse. The financial fiasco of 'Bryter Layter' and Boyd's move (which he interprets as a betrayal) makes him more depressed and inward. Nick's worried parents calls Boyd in L.A., saying they want Nick to see a psychiatrist; but he doesn't want to. Boyd:<br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"...they asked me to call and talk to him. And I did. He had this way of answering the telephone as if he just happened to have this thing in his hand and he was surprised to hear a voice come out of it. We talked for a while and he was very unhappy, and I told him he should see a psychiatrist, there was nothing wrong with it, maybe it would help him." (Lubow) </FONT></UL><br> Finally, in 1971, his parents manage to get Nick to a psychiatrist in London. They drive to Sct. Thomas, one of the biggest hospitals in London, and get in touch with the head psychiatrist, a man famous for his work with depressive patients. Molly Drake:<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"But something went wrong between us - it never really worked. And after all: What do psychiatrists really know. They are fumbling in darkness too..." (Rasmussen p.75-76)</FONT></UL><br> Nick leaves the hospital with a prescription of three different antidepressant drugs. The doctor has declared that this is a case of an inner depression, i.e. one that can't be explained by external circumstances (childhood, upbringing, puberty etc). Nick is interested neither in the psychiatrist, nor the pills, but he follows the prescription. For a month. Then he starts and stops taking the pills as if he were taking aspirins for a headache. He is a bit better when he takes them, but stops since he wants to get through without them. <br><br> This is not a reaction to some temporary misfortune, it's a black fog that will cover him for three tormented years. He has a daily routine of sitting in a chair, gazing out of the window or stare at his feet. Sometimes he sits there in total darkness. He has by now moved back to his parents in Tanworth-In-Arden, but he is now and then driving to London. Sometimes he will change his mind half way there and drive back.<br><br> As the situation's growing worse, he even stops talking. One is only able to drag a 'yes' or a 'no' out of him. "I wish I could meet someone who's gone through what I have", he tells a friend. Another friend, Paul Wheeler, recalls:<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"After 'Bryter Layter' it went straight down. He came here [London] sometimes and it was obvious that this depression, no... this despair he felt damaged him. What was going on in his head was something uncontrollable. He complained about evrything going out of hands. That he was controlled by powers beyond his reach - the record company, the business men... the whole system". (Rasmussen p.80)</FONT></UL><br> An interesting note is made by Robert Kirby, a note that is a fine illustration of Nick Drake, both his music and his person:<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nick was in some strange way out of time. When you were with him, you always had a sad feeling of him being born in the wrong century. If he would have lived in the 17th Century, at the Elizabethan Court, together with composers like Dowland or William Byrd, he would have been alright. Nick was elegant, honest, a lost romantic - and at the same time so cool. <br> In brief: the perfect Elizabethan." (Rasmussen p.80-81)</FONT></UL><br> It's 1971. Nick will often leave home without telling anyone. His parents must call all his friends to see if he's alright. Nick has a lot of music running through his head, but he can't write, can't get it down. Chris Blackwell at Island Records offers him an apartment on the Spanish coast. When he returns to England in October 1971, he calls John Wood, telling him he wants to make a new album. Wood has received instructions from the company to record anything with Nick - anytime - so he tells Nick to come over. He arrives at midnight, pale faced, looking like a man who's been losing too much sleep. Nick sits down in the studio, perfectly in tune as always, and plays his songs in an unbroken suite. The record, 'Pink Moon', is recorded in two hours. Other sources claims that the songs were cut in two days, which actually sounds more reasonable.<br><br> A couple of days later, they meet to work out the arrangements. Nick puts on some piano on the title track, Pink Moon, but that's it. "I don't want them arranged", says Nick, "no frills".<br> The album is short, about 30 minutes, but Nick haven't got any more songs. In Robert Kirby's eyes 'Pink Moon' is the finest work Nick ever did. And an astonishing achievment: during the recording he was so depressed that he could barely speak, so confused that he would stand helplessly at an intersection, unable to cross.<br><br> Nick is now in possession of the finished tape, but one problem remains: he must bring it to Island Records. And explain why there are no arrangements. Nick drives to the office, but when he reaches the door, ha can't go through with it. Without a word, he leaves the tape with the receptionist. A few days later, someone actually decides to open the package and they realize that it's the new Nick Drake album.<br><br> Do I have to mention that this personal, stark album, released in February 1972, sells even less than its predecessors? I think not. Apparently, the public isn't ready for 'Pink Moon'. Here's a quote from Al Clark's review in Time Out:<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sadly Nick Drake is likely to remain in the shadows, the private troubadour of those who have been fortunate enough to catch an earful of his excuisite 3am introversions." (Keep, p.73)</FONT></UL><br> After the recording of 'Pink Moon', the life of Nick Drake is getting even darker than before. He now lives permanently at his parents' house. In the afternoons you can hear the sound of Bach's Brandenburg concerts. But the volume is turned down, hardly hearable. And when the record comes to an end, Nick lets the pick-up go on and on, listening to the sound for hours.<br><br> Another hint of the tragic and confusing circumstances that Nick lives under during this period, is the press information from Island Records upon the release of 'Pink Moon':<br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nobody is really sure where Nick lives these days. We're pretty sure he left his flat in Hampstead some time ago. We have a bank agreement for him so that he's always got his rent money and some spending bread, so there's no need for him to make more appearances than he does. The chances of Nick actually playing in public are more than remote." (quote from Maconie, Q Magazine)</FONT></UL><br> Continue to <A HREF="NDghijkl.html#l">Last years</A><br><br><BR><FONT SIZE=5>Posthumous appreciation </FONT><br> The number of artists declaring their appreciation of Nick Drake's work is ever increasing and ranges from Elton John via Paul Weller to J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. Tom Verlaine, the leader of New York combo Television has uttered: "The very best of them all is Nick Drake", and it's no secret that the single two heroes of Robert Smith from The Cure are Ian Curtis and... Nick Drake. I could name numerous names, but the point to me seems to be that Nick is now beginning to receive the appreciation he never quite got during his lifetime. Joe Boyd (producer): <br><br><UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The phone calls from people wanting to do a book or a film on Nick Drake used to come in about twice a year. Now it's twice a month. Nick died 20 years ago, but his music seems more beautiful, more apt, more attuned now than it did when it was first recorded." (foreword to Way To Blue - An Introduction to Nick Drake)</FONT></UL><br> A perhaps more ambigous (definitely unexpected!) tribute to Nick Drake is Nike's use of a part of his song Know (from 'Pink Moon') in a commercial for sport shoes. The commercial was shown frequently in 1995 on MTV.<br><br> In 1992, a tribute album dedicated to Nick Drake was recorded. It's called 'Brittle Days' and contains more or less unknown artists doing covers of Nick Drake songs.

It didn't happen just tomy generation, but of course you look first to those you grew upwith; you see them lose their direction because of drugs, alcohol, sorrowand disappointment, you see them progressively withdraw into themselves.Think of a person like Nick Drake: a sportsman - happy and extrovert - whosuddenly closed up like a clam. It's very sad to see such a thing happen.The song is about these kinds of people, and it asks why life did all this to them,why they got lost and die young.<BR><BR>(from Luigi Prevosti)</FONT><br><br><FONT SIZE=5><A HREF="NDtime.html">Time Of No Reply</A> - the record - 1967-74<br></FONT> Album released in 1986 on Hannibal Records, consisting of previously unreleased tracks; outtakes, early home-made recordings and the last four recordings in 1974 - the year of his death.<br><br><A NAME="u"></A> <A NAME="v"></A> <A NAME="w"></A> <A NAME="x"></A> <A NAME="y"></A> <A NAME="z"></A><HR><BR><FONT SIZE=7>U, V, W, X, Y, Z</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=5>Wheeler, Paul<br></FONT> A folksinger and guitarist that Nick Drake met and became friends with at college in Cambridge.
