Might as well tune the top string to D for some sympathetic resonance I guess.Incidentally, the instrumental version of this song which appears on one of the "home recording" bootlegs is IDENTICAL to the guitar on the "rediscovered" track (ie the same take, not just the same notes). Interesting... did the guitar track of the 1974 studio recording somehow end up on a home tape, or was the 1974 recording merely a vocal overdub on a home guitar recording? Maybe John Wood knows..     Main riff: (only the bottom five strings are shown)     |--E--E--E--E--E-| |--X--X--X--X--T-| (the second and fourth (outro) times, |--T--T--T--T--X-|  the 4th chord is 00XTE, not 00TXE)|-0--0--0--0--0-0||0--0--0--0--0---|(where X=10th fret, E=11th, T=12th)Verse:|--E--E--E--E--E-|--E--E--E--E--E-| |--X--X--9--9--9-|--8--8--T--T--T-| |--T--T--T--T--T-|--T--T--T--T--T-| |-0--0--0--0--0-0|-0--0--0--0--0-0| |0--0--0--0--0---|0--0--0--0--0---|"If you call"     |----------------|--8--8--5--5--6-||--7--7--7--7--7-|--5--5--3--3--3-||--7--7--7--7--7-|--5--5--3--3--3-||-7--7--7--7--7--|-5--5--0--3--3-0||7--7--7--7--7--0|5--5--0--3--3---|notes:1. The B string is very quiet - perhaps try to play it quietly if yours is loud. You could certainly miss out the 8's in the "If You Call" bit if they sound too strong.2. Obviously, it doesn't matter which way round you hit the open G's in the bass!3. The first 7 on the high G string is a 10 the first time round - sounds like a possible mistake to me, and along with his finger positions for the rest of the "if you call" bit, suggest to me that he might well have had a finger on the 10th fret of the B string for the 7777 chord, even though it wasn't played, to stop the otherwise wrong-sounding major third note from sounding under his barre finger.4. The verse fingering is a little tricky: for the TXE try either ring, index, middle (so the index descends on the G string through the line - quite a stretch unless you have big hands and play a small guitar ;-) - and it ends with the little finger fretting the twelfth) or else little, index, ring - index finger still descends but it's less of a stretch, though to get the twelfth fret at the end either the little finger has to do both D and G strings or you have to reposition fingers. You can of course make the same notes for verse & riff on the top 3 strings lower down the neck - this version sounds closer on my guitar but you might want to try both.5. When you move from the end of the "If You Call" bit up to the riff, take care not to let the B string sound. I find this easiest by using my ring finger for the 5 on the B string, and keeping it fretted when the little finger adds the 6, then sliding it up the neck (so keeping the B string quiet) so the ring can do the 11th fret in the riff. Just my preference.Tabbed by Chris Healey<A HREF="../DRAKE/NDtabs2.html">All guitar tabs</A><br><br></BODY></HTML></pre><!Unregistered version.
