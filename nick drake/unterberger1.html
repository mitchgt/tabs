The broodingwistfulness, the bittersweet longing for the past, the cloud of despair atever quite fitting into the imperfect material world-the singer-songwriterdelivered all of the above in a low-key, melodic fashion that disguised theturbulence of his musings.  Tragically, he fulfilled another tenet of theromantic myth by dying at a young age, in circumstances that indicated apossible suicide.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        There's still much debate about whether Drake's death in 1974 atthe age of 26 was indeed by his own hand.  But almost all would agree thatthe folk-rocker was ill-equipped for a contented existence on this earth,let alone survival in the volatile industry of popular music.  Unable toeffectively communicate to other human beings except through his music, hemade three brilliant albums in the late '60s and early '70s that found fewlisteners during his lifetime.  In the matter of another tormented Britishgenius, Syd Barrett, these have generated a cult following among old andnew generations that simply grows and grows without leveling off.  Thereare probably many more times as many hardcore Drake fans now, over twodecades since his death, than he had at his prime.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Early home recordings by Drake in the late '60s (now bootlegged)show a promising British folkie in the mold of Donovan and less celebratedBritish guitarists such as Bert Jansch, mixing covers of '60s warhorseslike "Let's Get Together" with his own more idiosyncratic compositions.After seeing Drake support Country Joe McDonald at the Roundhouse inLondon, Ashley Hutchings of Fairport Convention recommended the Cambridgestudent to producer Joe Boyd.  Via his work with Fairport Convention andIncredible String Band (among others), Boyd, a young American based inLondon, had already built a resume as the top producer on the Britishfolk-rock scene.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Drake was signed to Boyd's Witchseason Productions company, and Joewas in the producer's chair for Nick's first album, Five Leaves Left(1969).  This was an astonishing debut for a 21-year-old, with a fargreater compositional and musical sophistication than the acoustic-orientedtunes on his home tapes.  Debts to Donovan, Tim Buckley, and Van Morrisonwere obvious, but run through a peculiarly British filter and Drake'sdistinctively jazzy, breathy vocals.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Working with a floating cast of session musicians including bassistDanny Thompson (moonlighting from top British folk ensemble Pentangle) and(on one track) Richard Thompson, Drake sang with a smoky, measured tonethat didn't suggest detachment nearly as much as a sort of foggymelancholy.  Read on their own, the lyrics had a downbeat longing vergingon despair.  But combined with the lovely, baroque orchestration (fellowCambridge student Robert Kirby, who had never worked in a studio before,did most of the arrangements), the songs grew into something more complexand intriguing.  Rarely had such a bitter pill been served in such asoothing package.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Boyd takes care to praise an oft-overlooked facet of the singer'smusic: "When you put aside the singing, lyrics, the arrangements, andeverything else, and you just listen to the guitar playing, you can hearthat Nick was an extraordinary musician with very, very strong technique,big strong hands.  The guitar playing was incredibly clean and accurate andinventive.  The way he developed his tunings, some people still haven'tfigured out some of his tunes."<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Although Drake's career encompassed only three proper albums, hisdiscography is remarkable in that each of the full-length works was quitedifferent from each other.  What's more, if you gather a roomful of NickDrake devotees and ask them to choose their favorite recording, the voteswould most likely be evenly split among the three.  Critics thus identifyDrake's "peak" at their peril, but it may be that Bryter Later (1970) washis most accessible work. From a purely musical viewpoint, it's his mostdiverse, with Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks from Fairport Conventionproviding most of the rhythm section work, and appearances by John Cale andRichard Thompson; female soul singers Doris Troy and Pat Arnold even dobackup vocals on "Poor Boy."  Robert Kirby again adds some beautifulclassical-influenced orchestral arrangements.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        The bemused, melodic grandeur of Drake's peculiar melancholiaremained unfettered.  The singer-songwriter took a most unusual chance bydispensing with lyrics and voice altogether for a few orchestratedinstrumental tracks, which rate among the most appealing selections on therecord.  Joe Boyd - a man who has produced records by Pink Floyd, R.E.M.,Richard Thompson, and several other legends - goes as far as to say, "It'sone of those albums that I can listen to without ever thinking, 'I shouldhave done this better.'  I enjoy it every time I hear it."<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Drake had left Cambridge to pursue music full-time in London afterFive Leaves Left, but it was soon apparent that Nick was rather toointroverted to play the pop star game.  He rarely played live to supportthe record; he probably gave no more than a dozen concerts in all after hisdebut LP, and never played at all in public after 1970.  There would beonly one unrevealing interview in the music press.  In an effort to makeNick's songs more widely known in the industry, Boyd even engaged EltonJohn-then a struggling singer-songwriter himself-to sing demos of severalof Drake's songs.  (The results, along other John-sung demos of songs byJohn Martyn and the Incredible String Band's Mike Heron, have since beenbootlegged.)<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Oddly enough for such an uncompromising artist, Drake placed a highvalue on commercial success, and when Bryter Later sold in very modestnumbers, he became severely depressed.  The already introverted musicianmoved back to his parents' house and began withdrawing from most forms ofsocial contact.  His form of mental illness took a more subdued, lessflamboyant aura than that of another legend of the era who withdrew intoseclusion, Syd Barrett.  Drake would sit motionlessly for hours on end orwander aimlessly.  In her biography, French pop singer Fran&ccedil;oise Hardyremembers how Nick sat in a corner, never saying a word, when he watchedher do a session for an album she was making in England in the early '70s.Drake, in Hardy's words, "was truly the champion of inhibition."  And,perhaps worst of all, he wasn't able to write more songs.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        "When we were doing Fran&ccedil;oise's album, Nick Drake came up and satnext to me in the control room," remembers guitarist Jerry Donahue.  "I wasjust making some friendly conversation.  He was very quiet in betweenquestions, there would just be a gap.  Then I'd ask another question.  Andeach time I did, his eyebrows would raise way up, his eyes would widen, andit was like an effort to kind of get the answer out to satisfy thesituation at hand - 'I've gotta deal with this - somebody's putting me on theline, they've actually addressed me and asked me a question.  I will do mybest to get an answer out.'<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        "Then having successfully managed to crank an answer out, he wouldwithdraw again into silence, until which time I might feel inclined to askhim another question, and the same sequence of events would take place.  Itwas very bizarre.  I've never known anybody like him.  And he wasn'tunfriendly.  But you just really felt like you were putting the guy on thespot when you'd ask the most simple harmless questions.  I thought he had areal rough time with himself.  It was impossible to get to know him,certainly in that brief encounter."<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Boyd knew Drake about as well as any of his musicalassociates-which is to say, he only knew him up to a point.  "He wasexpressive, but very quietly and very shyly," he observes.  "He'd neverbehave as what you would call an extrovert.  Sometimes you'd do somethingin the studio and I'd sort of look around and see what Nick thought of whatsomebody was doing as an overdub, or something like that.  He'd be lookingat his shoes, he'd kind of stutter a couple of times-'well, uh, I'm notsure I like this.'  He was very clear, but the texture of the behavior wasnever extroverted.  It was always very quiet and sort of self-contained,hesitant about voicing."<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Boyd himself was no longer available to work with Drake afterBryter Later, having moved to Los Angeles to work for Warner Brothers."The reasons he wasn't successful during his lifetime were a combination offairly simple things," he adds.  "First of all, he didn't build up a livefollowing or tour.  The example of someone who I guess could be a kind ofparallel to Nick in some ways and did do well [was] Leonard Cohen.  Hisrecords were released in North America at the height of the boom in FMradio, when people were playing a lot of album tracks.  He didn't toureither.  He didn't perform until well after he had become famous.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        "Because Nick's records weren't released in America until the early'70s, it was really down to England to make him a star.  He fell,unfortunately, in the period [of] the demise of [pirate radio].  All youhad was BBC Radio One and there wasn't really much room for album tracks orfor artists like Nick on radio in Britain.  Eliminate live performances,radio exposure-I mean, there isn't a lot there to get what he did across.But at the same time it's also true that I think the music doesn't reachout and grab people by the lapels.  It takes a bit of getting used to, andit's also very English.  I think for America at that time, a kind ofunassertive introspective English musician wasn't necessarily going to geta lot of attention."<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Drake did rouse himself out of his depression to record his finalalbum, Pink Moon (1972), with John Wood, who had engineered the first tworecords.  The ten songs were recorded in just two sessions, and often injust one take.  Featuring only Drake and his guitar (there was a pianooverdub on the title track), it was not just Nick unplugged, but utterlynaked.  His previous work could have never exactly been described ashappy-go-lucky, but this was certainly his bleakest effort.  Writing asthough each word cost a shilling, Drake chose to say more with less: thelyric of one song ("Know") is but 18 words in its entirety.  The leastcommercially viable of Drake's albums, it is also the one that commands themost devout champions among his fans.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Drake himself probably suspected that Pink Moon wasn't bound forTop of the Pops, delivering the tapes to Island Records' receptionistwithout a word (Island didn't realize it had the album until it opened thepackage after Drake left).  Shortly after its release, he checked himselfinto a psychiatric hospital for five weeks.  Thereafter he wrote littlemusic and rarely ventured out, except to see friends like fellow Britishfolk-rock guitarist John Martyn, who has added to the chorus of describingDrake (in Record Collector) as "the most withdrawn person I've ever met."<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Drake did manage to put down four more songs (since issued on theTime of No Reply collection), but the sessions for a prospective album wentinto limbo.  Fran&ccedil;oise Hardy once asked him to write for her, but nothingcame of it.  On November 25, 1974, with the fate of the fourth album stillundetermined, Drake was found dead in his bedroom in his parents' houseafter taking an overdose of antidepressant medication.  He left no note,and it was ruled a suicide by his coroner, although the verdict wasdisputed by his friends and family.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        Yet Drake's cult has now grown to the point where he has sold manymore records since his death than he did in his lifetime.  Famous musicianssuch as Jackson Browne, Peter Buck of R.E.M., and Tom Verlaine have citedtheir admiration for Nick's work.  But the bulk of his acclaim may comefrom the alternative rock underground, which finds an instant affinity withhis inability to fit in the world as we know it, even if few are able orwilling to specifically emulate his solitary sound.<BR><BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;        "The reason why it's successful now is because it's too good not tobe," summarizes Boyd.  "There are a lot of things which feel like they're apart of their time, and they have a fascination for that reason.  But Ithink Nick's music doesn't really feel that way.  His songs were veryrarely covered, which I think is partly due to his uniqueness and the factthat what he did was completely outside all trends and movements.  It feelskind of outside of time in a way, so it doesn't date.  People, once theysit down quietly and listen to a Nick Drake record, very rarely loseinterest after that."<BR><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">Recommended Recordings:<BR><BR>Fruit Tree (1985, Hannibal).  It may seem excessive to recommend a four-CDbox set as the definitive release.  But Drake's body of work was so strongthat once any single album is digested, nothing less than everything elsewill do.  This has all three of the albums he released during his lifetime,as well as a worthy collection of outtakes and demos, Time of No Reply.<BR><BR>The Complete Home Recordings (1996, Nixed).  With such a slim oeuvre tochoose from, Drake fans are eager for evidence of anything else that theman recorded.  This bootleg collection of over 20 home recordings doesn'tmatch his studio work in either songwriting or performance, but it's anifty and enjoyable document of his folk-based roots.<BR><BR><BR>Recommended Reading:<BR><BR>Nick Drake, by Patrick Humphries (1997, Bloomsbury, UK).  It's something ofa miracle that a 280-page biography could be fashioned from the life ofsomeone who only gave one interview, and rarely talked at all during hislast few years.  This does a commendable job, however, of fleshing out hisstory as much as possible, with numerous interviews with friends andassociates dating back to Drake's schoolboy years.  Inevitably many gapsremain, yet this manages to clarify many mini-myths which have sprung uparound Drake since his death, and offers lucid, passionate analysis of hisrecordings and compositions.<BR><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">Copyright © Richie Unterberger<BR>Used by permission</FONT></SPAN><BR><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">A selection of featured artists in "Unknown Legends of Rock 'n' Roll": The Collins Kids, Wanda Jackson, Graham Bond, The Creation, John's Children,The Chocolate Watch Band, The Music Machine, The Remains,The Blossom Toes, The Misunderstood, Syd Barrett,Nick Drake, Roky Erickson, Lee Hazlewood, Love, Joe Meek, Skip Spence, Scott Walker, Can, Fran&ccedil;oise Hardy, The Outsiders, The Plastic People of the Universe,Savage Rose, Sandy Denny, Davy Graham, The Holy Modal Rounders, ScreamingLord Sutch, Crass, The Raincoats, Rocket From the Tombs, X-Ray Spex, The Cleaners From Venus/Martin Newell, Chris Knox, The FreeSpirits, The Monks, Tomorrow, The United States of America, Young Marble Giants, Kevin Coyne,The Red Krayola/Mayo Thompson, Doris Troy, Robert Wyatt.
