So the six horizontal lineseach represent one string (lowest at the bottom, and with tuningsas given at the beginning of the tab piece), the numbers tell youwhich fret is played, and moving left to right along the tab isjust like moving through a bar of music.Incidentally, in some tab music the gaps between notes areintended as rough guides only; I've tried as far as possible inthese Nick Drake tabs to make them completely accurate (so youcan literally count the dashes between notes as a measure of thetiming).Some examples (in standard tuning):|----|----|0-2-   - play the open G string, followed by the G string|----     at the second fret (an A note)|----|----    |--0-3---|--1---1-     play a standard C chord,|--0-----   - then a G note on the top string,|--2-----     then a C on the B string and low C on |--3---3-     the A string at the same time.|--------     |--------|--------|----1---|----1---  - couple of open A's, an A minor chord, then|----2---|----2---    an open A and a quick E on the D string....|----2--2|----2--2    then repeat. You might recognise the start|0-0---0-|0-0---0-    of "Things Behind The Sun"!|--------|--------note that generally no hint is given as to left or right handfingering, (you just have to figure out for yourself whichfingers go where or pluck which string)), although in someof the trickier tabs I've made suggestions for the right hand(t-thumb, i-index, m-middle, r-ring, l-little).also, no clue is given in these tabs (or many others) as towhether notes hang across the gaps or are stopped - it's assumedyou know the piece of music well enough to imitate that yourself.Chris Healey<BR><BR></BODY></HTML></PRE><!Unregistered version.
