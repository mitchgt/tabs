First of all, he didn't build up alive following or tour. The example who I guess could be a kind of parallelto Nick in some ways and did do well [was] Leonard Cohen. His records werereleased in North America at the height of the boom in FM radio, whenpeople were playing a lot of album tracks. He didn't tour either. He didn'tperform until well after he had become a famous person.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Because Nick's records weren't released in America until the early '70s, itwas really down to England to make him a star. He fell, unfortunately, inthe period between the demise of the pirates. Really, all you had was BBCRadio One, and there wasn't really much room for album tracks or forartists like Nick on radio in Britain. Eliminate live performances, radioexposure - I mean, there isn't a lot there to get what he did across, and Ithink that...there were people in America. David Geffen was a big fan ofhis and was interested in releasing his records, [which] came out on Islandin America, which really wasn't very well organized at that point inAmerica.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;But at the same time, it's also true that I think the music doesn't reachout and grab people by the lapels. It takes a bit of getting used to, andit's also very English. I think for America at that time, a kind ofunassertive introspective English musician wasn't necessarily going to geta lot of attention.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;That's the reasons he wasn't successful at the time. The reason why it'ssuccessful now is because - it's very simple - it's too good not to be. I thinkthat his songs...there's a lot of wonderful stuff from that period inhistory, but a lot of things which were successful have a resonance becausethey remind people of a soundtrack to a kind of memory. "Sgt. Pepper's" isa timeless record, but there's a lot of records from that period which youcan't reassess in a way objectively because they become so much of a partof the whole culture's memory of the '60s. But there are a lot of thingswhich feel like they're a part of their time, and they have a fascinationfor that reason.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;But I think Nick's music doesn't really feel that way. It feels kind ofoutside of time in a way, and so it doesn't date. I think that hisoriginality and intelligence of what he did...people, once they sit downquietly and listen to a Nick Drake record, very rarely lose interest afterthat.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;You hear people say how much they loved Nick Drake, [yet] his songs werevery rarely covered, which I think is partly due to his uniqueness and thefact that what he did was...you can hear little echoes of other things thatwere going on at the time. But really, it was completely outside all trendsand all movements. I think people are influenced by him in a more abstractway.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">Looking at his three albums, they're quite different from eachother. Do you have a favorite phase of his development, or do you rate oneof his approaches more highly than the other?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> I like "Bryter Later" as album a lot. It's hard for me to beobjective because I was involved as a producer on the first two, and Ithink "Bryter Later" is the most successful production. It's one of thosealbums that I can listen to without ever thinking "I should have done thisbetter." I enjoy it every time I hear it. I would say that "Bryter Later"is my favorite.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">Nick has the image of being an extremely introverted person. Somecomments I've read indicated that in the studio, if he was going to beexpressive anywhere about his art or what he wanted to, that's when he was.Did you find that to be true?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> He was expressive, but very quietly, and very shyly. He'd neverbehave as what you would call an extrovert. Sometimes you'd do something inthe studio and I'd sort of look around and see what Nick thought of it andwhat somebody was doing as an overdub or something like that. He'd belooking at his shoes, he'd kind of stutter a couple of times, 'Well, uh,I'm not sure I like this." He was very clear, but the texture of thebehavior was never extroverted. It was always very quiet and sort ofself-contained, hesitant about voicing.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> Had Nick been able to have a long career, do you have any idea ofhow his music might have developed?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> It's impossible to say, but I think when you listen to the guitarplaying on the records, and put aside the singing, lyrics, and everythingelse, the arrangements, and you just listen to the guitar playing, you canhear that Nick was an extraordinary musician with very, very strongtechnique, big strong hands, the guitar playing was incredibly clean andaccurate and inventive. The way he developed his tunings, some people stillhaven't figured out some of his tunes. I think he would have continued todevelop as...not an eccentric person who happened to catch a wave at acertain time creatively and come up with some interesting stuff. He was areally deeply rooted musician with a lot of technique and a lot ofawareness and intelligence and skill. I think he could have gone whereverhe wanted to, really.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> How did those Elton John demos of his songs come about? [EltonJohn demoed some Drake compositions; those performances have sincecirculated on bootlegs.]<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> I hired him to do it. We did a session with Linda Thompson andElton John. She sang half the songs and he sang half the songs. Some of thesongs were Nick's, some were John Martyn's, some were Mike Heron's, SandyDenny, Richard Thompson, all our writers were represented at that session.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2"><CENTER> PART TWO: SANDY DENNY </CENTER><BR>Question: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">With Fairport Convention, you were in the position to observe theband with both Judy Dyble and Sandy Denny. How do you feel the bandchanged? What did she add that hadn't been there before?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> I think Sandy was a completely different person than Judy, a muchmore powerful singer, a much stronger voice for a start. So you hadsomething much more - I think the band became less tentative with Sandy,because Judy was a delicate singer. I think there might have been a littlebit of a feeling of holding back or hesitancy about being too aggressive inthe band because the vocalist was so tentative, frail.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;But with Sandy, you had a powerhouse. I think she boosted the band'sconfidence in a way because she was quite well known as a solo artist. Thefact that she chose to join Fairport I think boosted all of theirconfidence level in themselves as a band. And then she brought her ownsongwriting, great songs, and then ultimately I think she was really thekey person ultimately responsible for introducing them to English folkmusic, because she had a large repertoire of songs that she used to singwith the band on the road or in hotel rooms after concerts and things.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> In their earlier recordings, there's much more of an emphasis onfolk-rock as it was played by [US] West Coast groups of the time, and thenby "Liege and Lief" the emphasis had shifted very much toward Englishtraditional material. How would you compare the eras?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> The defining event which led to the "Liege and Lief" period,which made Fairport what it has come to be ever since, was the caraccident, where Martin Lamble was killed. The group at that time at firstwas very unsure that they would play together again. When they began toconsider the possibility of reforming, they were very, very clear that theywould never perform the old songs that Martin had played on. They wouldhave to start from scratch with repertoire. They wouldn't go back and tryto redo things they'd done with Martin. That led to the question, what willwe do, what kind of repertoire will we do. I think that they had been veryvery...that all happened around the time [the Band's] "Music From Big Pink"came out, that was a big influence on them. They were very stunned by thatrecord. I think they felt inspired by it to...it was so American, so rootedin American traditions that they felt that if they could come up with akind of music which was as English as that record was American, that itwould justify reforming as a group.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;It had already begun to be interesting during "Unhalfbricking" with "ASailor's Life," but it hadn't really occurred to them to just go completelyover to that other direction. That was the thing that triggered thatchange.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> How would you rate her work subsequent to Fairport?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> She made some great records. It's a little hard for me to beobjective, because I produced the ones with Fairport and [not] thesubsequent ones. I wasn't too fond of Fotheringay as a band. I felt theyhad strengths and weaknesses. I think I didn't always agree with TrevorLucas' choices as a producer on her subsequent albums. But there arefantastic tracks - "Solo," "My Donkey Ride" - from her solo albums, absolutelystunning tracks. I think she probably developed, improved as a songwriter.She got off to a very good start as a songwriter by writing "Who KnowsWhere the Time Goes" as her first song. But then you don't really think offantastic songs of hers, memorable songs she wrote during the years she waswith Fairport. She collaborated on a couple of good ones, she obviouslysang fantastically well. But it wasn't, I think, until she left Fairport,in a way, that she started coming into her own as a songwriter on thingslike "The Sea" (with Fotheringay). It's just a fantastic body of work, mostof which as a songwriter comes after she left Fairport.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> In Fairport, there were a few songwriters, which meant they mightnot have had the chance to record all of their material until they meantsolo?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> I suppose. The group was more important than the individuals.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> How have you heard Sandy's influence subsequent to her career?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> Every time you hear a woman singing folk...Like anythinginnovative, they opened up a lot of Pandora's boxes. What they did was sostrong that it's impossible in a way for a European rock band, NorthernEuropean rock band, to address its own traditional music in a rock contextwithout quoting, in some way, from Fairport. Usually I find it depressingto listen to because the excesses of...to me, it's a kind of pale copy ofwhat Fairport were doing. The same thing goes for women singers singingtraditional music, particularly of the British Isles, in a modern context.You hear echoes of Sandy in an awful lot of contemporary female singers whohave a feeling for tradition of some kind.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2"><CENTER> PART THREE: SYD BARRETT </CENTER><BR>Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> When you worked with the Pink Floyd, how did you view Syd'sbehavior changing during that time?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> During the period I was really working with them, I never sawparticular problems. I guess the period that I was in close contact withthe group would be not that long a period, from October '66 untilFebruary/March of '67, a six-month period. And during that period I got toknow them, worked on trying to get them a deal, presented them at UFO, andrecorded three tracks in the studio with them.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;And all during that period, Syd was a delight. He was absolutely fine towork with, he was a little spacy but not much, he was witty and funny andenergetic, and really the source for all the band material and the kind ofcenterpiece of the band. Roger [Waters] was a kind of anchor, the one whowould organize the group's thoughts, in a way. But Syd was the spark. Thatwas true very consistently from the time I first met them right throughMarch, when we did "Interstellar Overdrive."<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;And then, really, after that, I saw them only a few more times. The mostmemorable time being...They played four or five times at UFO in the earlyperiod, and then the single came out and the price went up and we couldn'tafford them and there was some sort of...they were a little bit guiltybecause I was sort of losing them on two fronts, as a producer and [at theUFO]. Everybody knew they were just going to get bigger and bigger andbigger. So I asked, and they agreed, to come back and play the UFO threemonths later [for] their last gig at UFO.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;By June, when they came back to play the UFO, they were huge, and it wasjust a mob scene. That was where, I've told the story before, but...it wasabsolutely packed. You couldn't move. The band kind of elbowed their waythrough the crowd, and I had to sort of push them in the backs to make roomfor them to get in because there was no backstage entrance. And that waswhen I saw Syd for the first time in three months. I guess I'd seen himfrom a distance and people had told me that he'd taken a LOT of acid. Helooked completely changed, he just looked like there was nobody home. Hejust stopped playing on stage.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> The recordings that [subsequent Pink Floyd producer] Norman Smithmade: would there be any way you would have recorded the materialdifferently?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> I don't think so. I think "Piper at the Gates of Dawn" was a verygood record. I think "Bike" is the best track they ever did. So even thoughI was pissed off at the time, I was very gratified when the band had tocome back to Sound Techniques and use my engineer to get the sound theywanted for "See Emily Play." I was expecting the LP, when they finallyproduced it, to be something that I would not like or something. In fact, Ithought it was pretty good. It's very hard to say.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> What did you think the group lost and gained when Syd left?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> Syd wrote three-minute pop songs. Slightly weird pop songs, butthey were three-minute compositions. The group, in live performance, wouldalso do these long instrumentals, and they would extend songs of Syd's bythese long solo sections. I've heard them doing a ten-minute version of"Arnold Layne." But still there was a structure, and a song. When Sydstopped being the man who wrote all their material, the whole structure ofthings changed. They became much more of an instrumental group, with thelyrics and the singing as something...it wasn't separate, but like anintroduction to the instrumental, a jumping off point place for aninstrumental work. I think Roger as a songwriter, and Dave Gilmour for thatmatter, both...they don't have the wit that Syd had. Syd was a very funnyand inventive songwriter, and they don't really have that. But they do havesomething that probably may be more commercial than what Syd had, a kind ofparticular almost Wagnerian chord progressions that give their instrumentalstuff a unique sound that was present in some of Syd's songs. "InterstellarOverdrive" is much more, in a way, a signpost forward to what they became,[than] the kind of music he wrote, which is...you can tell a Pink Floydchord progression a mile away, there's something about it which isabsolutely characteristic of them. The fact that it was primarilyinstrumental is one of the reasons why they can be as famous in Malaya andBrazil and Russia as they were in the United Kingdom and the United States.<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;Syd and the Pink Floyd, that's one of the extraordinary things aboutthem...there are very few imitators. Pink Floyd kind of exist somewhere ontheir own.<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Question:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> What do you think of Syd's solo material?<BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt2">Joe Boyd:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> I find it a little difficult to listen to because I remember Sydas a much more...as a better songwriter, I suppose. It was a bit painful ina way, it seemed...there were some good songs, as I recall, but it was acuriosity in a way, not something you held up as being great work by agreat songwriter, it was kind of..."This is Syd Barrett, he used to be inPink Floyd."<BR> &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the great sorrows in my collection is that I don't have the demotape that Syd gave me of like six or eight songs that he hadn't recorded. Iwas recording a band called the Purple Gang and we were looking formaterial, and Syd gave us this tape. There were some terrific songs, verydifferent from [what's on his solo LP] "The Madcap Laughs." Melodic, strongmelodic good songs.<BR><BR><BR>Copyright © Richie Unterberger<BR>Used by permission</FONT></SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><SPAN CLASS="links"><CENTER><B>Books by Richie Unterberger:</FONT></B><P><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="bilder/unterberger1.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=126><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="bilder/unterberger2.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH=84 HEIGHT=126><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="bilder/unterberger3.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH=89 HEIGHT=126><IMG ALIGN=TOP SRC="bilder/unterberger4.gif" BORDER="0" WIDTH=91 HEIGHT=126><P><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><B><SPAN CLASS="links">Buy the books on-line:</FONT></B><BR><FORM METHOD="get"ACTION="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/external-search"><TABLE BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" ALIGN="center"><TR><TD BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="mode" VALUE="books" CHECKED>Books</TD><TD ROWSPAN="2" VALIGN="top" ALIGN="center" bgcolor="#ffffff"width="55%">Enter keywords...<center><INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="keyword" SIZE=20 VALUE=""><INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=tag VALUE=thenickdrakefile></center><INPUT TYPE="submit" BORDER=0 VALUE="Search" NAME="Search"><BR><BR></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="top" ALIGN="center" BGCOLOR="#000000" ><A HREF="http://www.Amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect-home/thenickdrakefile"><IMG SRC="bilder/amazonlogo2.gif" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" ALT="Amazon.co.uk logo"></A></TD></TR></TABLE></FORM><BR><SPAN CLASS="links">Or at:<BR><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com"><FONT SIZE=2>Amazon USA</FONT></A><BR><A HREF="http://www.books.mfi.com/scripts/store/vsc/store/screens/shophome.htm?L+/htdocs/books/config/store+otbt9524"><FONT SIZE=2>Miller Freeman Books Online Store</FONT></A><BR><BR><BR><A HREF="unterberger1.html"><FONT SIZE=2>RICHIE UNTERBERGER: NICK DRAKE</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.richieunterberger.com/">RICHIE UNTERBERGER'S HOMEPAGE</FONT></A></SPAN><BR><BR></TD></TR></TABLE</BODY></HTML>
