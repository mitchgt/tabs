I enjoyedthis night more than any night out I've had, music-related or otherwise, inmonths, and I was alone, didn't even have company, except for the perhaps90-odd Nick Drake and Duncan Sheik fans who showed up for it also.  TheBrooklyn Academy of Music is possibly one of the only signs of intelligentlife in a borough where, even in rather affluent and "hip" Park Slope, thereare no decent record stores and one Barnes and Noble (not even a very goodone, as they go), and that's about it.The fact that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">BAM</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> Cafe, upstairs from the main theatre, with itsintimate seating, comfy couches, festive lighting, hosted this particularshow for free is an unbelievable icing on the sumptuous cake that theartists presented here tonight.<BR><BR>    Though I've been aware of Duncan Sheik for a while now, I confess not toreally know his material, but I've heard a few songs here and there and haveheard so much positive press about him that I was looking to investigate himsoon anyway, and of course the fact that he's a Nick Drake fan/scholar onlymakes him more worth investigating.  Irish performer Gerry Leonard was alsofascinating in his own right, performing three songs of his own to open theshow, and his guitar work and "ambient" extra accompaniment served to placehim firmly in Nick Drake style while showing off this man's own considerabletalents.  I could see that Duncan picked his partner with great care forthis showcase.<BR><BR>    What's there to really say about </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">PINK MOON</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> that hasn't been said, but Ican attest that Duncan and Gerry pulled it off with great aplomb, skill,feeling, and even humor and a few funny mistakes, mostly during tuning upand down and a very few false starts, and played the entirety of Pink Moon,plus a wonderful, hypnotic bonus of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">RIVER MAN</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, for the decent, if notstanding room only, cafe crowd.  I even noticed a few Monty Pythonreferences... when Gerry and Duncan were about to launch into </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">HARVEST BREED</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">,Duncan mentioned that "we'd like to perhaps ask the audience what the'Harvest Breed' actually is, what do you think it is... raise your hands??"etc. etc.  Gerry tartly chimed in with the "What is your favorite color?"crucial, but deadly, question from the bridge sequence from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt">, a reference which a few of the audience guffawed at inshared recognizance.<BR><BR>    I thought this a brilliant thing all around; to do this album as well asthey did, and given, even in its brevity, the relative "seriousness" of itand level of darkness, and then to undercut it just slightly with some comicrelief, was simply a masterful idea.  Duncan's vocals do more than justiceto Nick's, without being slavish to him in any way.  He did the songsstraight but with not too much reverence, just enough I thought.  The pair'sguitar work was simply marvelous, the interplay between the two's guitar andoccasional trade-off of vocals bringing the album to haunting life withastonishing clarity and depth.  I'm still not sure of how much Nick'srecording of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">PINK MOON</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> was one-take or one guitar (with minimal overdub,double-tracking, etc.), but the fact that it takes two of these fine fellowsto recreate the album live is not a detriment to them at all, but rather yetanother welcome tribute to just how great Nick's virtuousity really was andis.<BR><BR>    Now of course I'll have to go out and dig up Duncan's back catalog,which I'm sure is more than worthwile a task judging from his fine,delightfully unassuming (and totally unpretentious, something even moreworthy of note!) performance tonight.  Likewise for anything of GerryLeonard, who seemed a gracious and humble performer by his relative quietand shyness, and his wry sense of humor.<BR><BR>    I didn't stick around to thank or talk to Duncan, though I might have,instead I stayed long enough to add my name to the mailing list.  Seems theguys might do another show or two of this sort in the near future, somethingwhich I think anyone on this list living in the NYC metro. area need takenote of for next time.  Hopefully they'll do one or two after the holidays,when people have more time to catch weeknight shows like this.  I can'tthank them and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">BAM</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> enough for making this a free show, I bought two drinksand still felt like it wasn't enough to give back for such a rare andwonderful experience as this.  At the Bottom Line they charge $25 or morefor a show like this, and </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">BAM</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> does it for free somehow.  I guess I can thankMayor G. for something... or maybe not, but either way, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt3">BAM</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="txt"> is truly atreasure and I vow to spend much more time there in the near future.<BR><BR>    Hope this gives everyone some idea of the show tonight... I truly amglad I didn't skip this one, it was a brief show of course, but one toremember with great fondness.  Kudos to all involved... let's have anotherone, tomorrow!!<BR><BR><BR><A HREF="NDnews.html">Back to the News page</A>      </td>    </tr>    <tr>       <td height="124" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"> <div align="center"><A HREF="DRAKE.html"><img src="bilder/NDfri.GIF" vspace="5" border="0"></A></div></SPAN> </td>    </tr>  </table></TD></TR></TABLE></div></body></html>
