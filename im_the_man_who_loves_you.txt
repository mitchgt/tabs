(A riff) *

A
All I can see is black and white and white and pink with blades of blue that 
Lay between the words I think on a page that I was meaning to send to  
D
You I couldn't tell if it bring my heart  
The way I wanted when I started writing this letter to you 

(A riff)

E
If I could you know I would just hold your hand and you'd understand 
D
I'm the man who loves you 

(A riff)

A
All I can be is a busy sea of spinning wheels and hands that feel and 
Stones that throw and feet that run but come back home and
D
Make no difference ever known, they make no difference ever known to me 

(A riff) 

    E
And if I could you know I would just hold your hand and you'd understand 
D
I'm the man who loves you 

(A riff)

A
All I can see is black and white and white and pink with blades of blue that

You I couldn't tell if it bring my heart  
The way I wanted when I started writing this letter to you 
E
If I could you know I would just hold your hand and you'd understand 
Bm
If I could you know I would just hold your hand and you'd understand 
D
If I could you know I would just hold your hand and you'd understand 
D
I'm the man who loves you 
I'm the man who loves you
I'm the man who loves you

[A riff]

* A riff = A sus4 twice on a downstroke, then upstroke to a normal A, 
whack the 4th string still holding the chord and hammer on the fourth 
fret with your third finger then go back to the A chord. 
You'll have to listen carefully, but its easy once you get it. 

** solo = A riff, strum the D chord while on the fourth string: 
2h4, back to D, 3rd string: 2h4p2, 4th string 0h2p0, A riff, 
then hit the sixth string while hitting the fifth at the second fret 
and sliding up to the fourth fret a few times, then after a few times 
go up to the fifth fret, then back to the D, once there 4th string 0h2p0, 
back to A riff. Sorry if this is confusing, I don't know a better way 
to explain it.
