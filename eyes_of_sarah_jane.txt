We couldn't sleep
Laugh 'til we weep
Then time stood still, so still, so still

Talked for hours in our little bed
I fell in love with every word you said
It felt so great, so great, so great

I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again

Those were the days
Those were the days

I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again
