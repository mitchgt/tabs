sometimes I just have ot say your name 
(Currie/Harvie) 
INTRO - D Em7 F#m7 A

          D             Em7
With the sweet drip of every raindrop 
 F#m7                     Em7
Time brings you closer to me 
          D                      Em7          
And with each new sign at every train-stop 
  F#m7                     Em7               D
Another hour without you is consigned to history 

(same as first verse)
And with each tick of my alarm clock 
I get crazy for the days to get to you 
When I can hold you and kiss you and have you 
Instead of staring at some photo like a fool 
        G                               Em7
But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight 
         G                              A   D/A A7
When I think that I might not make it through 

           D                 G              D
But honey sometimes I just have to say your name 
            G                      Em7
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same 
      Em7                       G
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do 
              A                       G           A          D      
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name 

(Same as first verse)
So this morning I picked up the paper 
In the useless descent of the rain 
While partners in heartbreak the whole world over 
Lie and cheat just the same 
And the headlines proclaim everything has changed 
Love can't save you now 
As each little motion of my writswatch 
Holds up my faith somehow 

But as day turns to night there's this hopelessness to fight 
When I think that I might not make it through 

But honey sometimes I just have to say your name 
To hear it hanging in the air, to know it sounds the same 
And sometimes when I'm blue, I know just what to do 
To keep the blues at bay you know I only have to say your name 

           G                D
When I've used up all my patience 
            G                                     D
When your letters have been read twenty times through 
        F#m7                      G
I can drink all the wine in this place of mine 
        Em7     
But it ain't no replacement 

    A                        D    F#m7  Bm7  A  Em7  G  A   - lead into chorus
It ain't no replacement for you
