Dancing in the Dark

I get up in the evening
And I ain't got nothing to say
I come home in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way

I ain't nothing but tired
Just tired and bored with myself
Hey there baby
I could use a little help

Can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving around my place
Check my look in mirror
Want to change my clothes, my hair, my face

Man I'm getting nowhere
Just sitting around here in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby I just know there is

Can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

We sit around getting older
There's a joke some where and it's on me
I shake this world off my shoulder
Come on baby the laughs on me

Stay round the streets of this town
They'll be carving you up alright
Say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight

I'm dying for some action
Sick of sitting around here trying to write this book
Need a love reaction
Come on baby give me just one look

Can't start a fire
Sitting around crying with a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

Can't start a fire
Worry about your little world falling apart

Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey Baby
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
