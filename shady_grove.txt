Chorus:
Shady Grove my little love
Shady grove I say
Shady Grove my little love
I'm a-bound to go away

Cheeks as red as a blooming rose
And eyes of the prettiest brown;
She's the darling of my heart
The prettiest little girl in town

I wish I had a glass of wine
And bread and meat for two;
I'd set it all on a golden plate
And give it all to you

(Chorus)

I wish I had me a big fine horse
And the corn to feed him on
Little Shady Grove to stay at home
And feed him while I'm gone

When I went to see my Shady Grove
She was a-standing in the door
Her shoes and stockings in her hand
And her little bare feet on the floor

(Chorus)

Now when I was a little boy
I wanted a Barlow knife
And now I want little Shady Grove
to say she'll be my wife

A kiss from little Shady Grove
Is as sweet as brandywine
And there ain't no girl in this whole world
That's prettier than mine

(Chorus)
