Peaceful Easy Feeling

I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert tonight
With a billion stars all around

I've got a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standing on the ground

I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
All that she can take you anyway
You don't already know how to go

I got a peaceful easy feeling
I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standing on the ground

Something tells me I may know you
As a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whispering in my other ear
Telling me I may never see you again

I got a peaceful easy feeling
And I know you won't let me down
Cause I'm already standing
I'm already standing
Yes I'm already standing
On the ground
