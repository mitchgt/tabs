INTRO:          
[C   F   G   G   C   F   G   G]

VERSE ONE:      
Well, I [C]found a bunch of letters
They were [F]written for the fellow
Who [G]broke your momma's heart
And the [C]envelope folds [F]smelled of her ancient per[G]fume
[F]I'll bet she didn't [G]know
How to re[C]spond to forty [C/B]blankets of [Am]snow
[Am/G]Caught him out [F]wandering a[G]lone
With no place to [C]go [F C]

CHORUS I:       
[F] There were stars in the [C]sky
There were [C]houses on the [C/B]hill
There were [Am]bottles and [Am/G]pills
That were [F]easy to buy to [G]keep her warm
From the [C]oncoming storm [F C]

VERSE TWO:      
Well, I found them in the northwest corner of the attic
In a box labeled "Tinsel and Lights"
Didn't know what I was looking for
Maybe just a blanket or artifacts
Eisenhower sent him to war
He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart
And when he hit shore, it must have been a target
For the gunner-men

CHORUS II:      
There were stars in the sky
There were bunkers in the hill
And there were caskets to fill where he would lie
Shrouded in the red, white & blue with the stripes

repeat CHORUS I
