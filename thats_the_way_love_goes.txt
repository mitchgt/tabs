That's the way love goes

[C] I've been throwing [Gm] horse [C7] shoes
[F] Over my left [G] shoulder
[F] I've spent most [C] all my life
[D7] Searching for that [G] four leaf clover

[C] Yet you run [Gm] with [C7] me
[F] Chasing my [G] rainbows
[F] Honey I love [C] you too
[G] And that's the way love [C] goes

[C] That's the way love [Gm] goes [C7] babe
[F] That's the music [G] God made
[F] For all the [C] world to sing
[D7] It's never old [G] it grows

[C] Losing makes me [Gm] sorry [C7]
[F] You say honey [G] now don't worry
[F] Honey I love [C] you too
[G] And that's the way love [C] goes
