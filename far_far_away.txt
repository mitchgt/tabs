Far, Far Away
Capo II for my voice

[G] Far, far away from those [Bm] city lights
[Em] Might be shinin on [Bm] you tonight [Bbm]
[Am] Far, far away from [C] you
On the [G] dark side [Em] of the [C] moon [G]

[G] I long to hold you in my [Bm] arms and sway
[Em] Kiss and ride on the [Bm] CTA [Bbm]
[Am] I need to see you [C] tonight
And those [G] bright lights [Em] [C] [Am]
Oh I [G] know it's right [Em] [C] [G] 
Deep in my [Em] heart [C] [Am]
I [G] know it's right [Em] [C] [G] 

[todo: solo tab]

By the bed, by the light that you read by
By the time that I get home to say goodnight
I need to see you again 
On the dark side my friend
[G] [Em] [C] [G]
On the dark side my friend
