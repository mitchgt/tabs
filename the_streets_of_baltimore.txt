The Streets of Baltimore

[: G | C | G | C | D | D | C | G :]

I sold the farm to take my woman where she longed to be
We left our friends and all her kin back there in Tennessee
I bought those one way tickets that she was begging for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore

Her [D] eyes they shone with laughter when she [C] saw those city [G] lights
She said the prettiest place on earth is Baltimore at [D] night
A [G] man feels proud to [C] give his women [G] what she's longing [C] for
And I [D] kind of like the streets of Baltimore [G]

verse chords

I got myself a factory job I ran an old machine
I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
When I come home from working late with every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the streets of Baltimore

I'd give anything to take her back to what she used to be
But I guess she loved those city lights more than she loved me
So I'm headed home on that same train
That brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

So I'm headed home on that same train that brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
