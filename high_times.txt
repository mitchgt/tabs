Intro - Am  F  C  G

            Dm            F        Bb         F
Little snow white, she is sleeping 24 hours a day 
            Dm            F    Bb                    F
She's got a right to be lazy, flat out of reasons to breathe 
           Dm                F
And it's cold baby, yes it's cold 
    Bb                      G*                  G#
But everything is relative can't you see we're living in 

Am    F     C           G
High times, dig the new domain 
               Am   F                 C                  G
Living through high times, just don't crash my spiritual plane 

Little snow white, she was hungry 
Told to go out and graft for it 
At the end of the rainbow she was mind blown 
To be staring at a crock of shit 
And it's hard baby, yes it's hard 
But with a little intuition you can shift position in the 

High times, touch the magic stone 
Living through high times, pick up that spiritual phone. 

Frittering packs of refuseniks, too drunk to muster any contempt 
10 ways to relax on a cruise ship, one way to cover the rent 
I've whored myself around enough to know, baby 
You don't come with the customers and smile when you're spoken to in 

High times, catch the cosmic vibe. 
Living through high times, hey, has Ginger Baker died? 
Living through high times, my planet's all out of line 
Living through high times, man, just like '69
