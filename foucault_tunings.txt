Guitar Tunings :: Miles from the Lightning (2001)

The Songs on Miles from the Lightning are keyed strangely, because the 1973 Martin D-18 I recorded with played nicest when tuned 1/2 step below standard pitch. Consequently the various open tunings named below are actually just reference points for the intervals used; the real note names will be 1/2 step below those given. The keys named however, are the actual key the song is in.
