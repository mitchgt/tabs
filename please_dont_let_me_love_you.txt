PLEASE DON'T LET ME LOVE YOU
Recorded by Hank Williams, Sr.
Words and music by Ralph Jones

Oh! [D] Plea-ease - don't let me [G] love you
Just be-[D] cause I'm feelin' [A7] blue
And [D] Plea-ease - don't let me [G] kiss you
'Cause I [D] know you-[A7] ll be un-[D] true.

Because you're [A7] sweet dear, I want to [D] love you
[E7] Plea-ease - stay away from my [A7] heart
And [D] Plea-ease - don't let me [G] love you
'Cause I [D] know you-[A7] ll break my [D] heart.

Oh! Plea-ease - don't call me darlin'
When I know you don't love me
And Plea-ease - don't whisper sweetheart
For I know it just can't be

When I'm lonely, I want you only
Where is the dream I once knew
Oh! Plea-ease - don't let me love you
'Cause I know you'll be untrue.
