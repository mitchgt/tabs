LYIN' EYES

[G] City girls just [GM7] seem to find out [C] early
[Am] how to open doors with just a [D] smile
A [G] rich old man and [GM7] she won't have to [C] worry
she'll [Am] dress up all in [C] lace and go in [G] style

Late at night a big old house gets lonely
I guess every form of refuge has its price
And it breaks her heart to think her love is only
Given to a man with hands as cold as ice

So she tells him she must go out for the evening
To comfort an old friend who's feeling down
But he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'
She's headed for that cheatin' side of town

Chorus:
You can't [G] hide [C] your lyin' [G] eyes
and your [Em] smile [Bm] is a thin [Am] disguise [D]
I thought by [G] now [GM7] you'd [C] realize [A]
there [Am] ain't no way to [D] hide those lying [G] eyes

On the other side of town a boy is waiting
with stormy eyes and dreams no-one could steal
She drives on throught the night anticipating
Cos she makes him feel the way she used to feel

She rushes to his arms they fall together
She whispers that its only for a while
She says that soon she'll be coming back forever
She pulls away and leaves him with a smile

(Chorus)

She gets up and pours herself a strong one
And stares out at the stars up in the sky
Another night, it's gonna be a long one
She draws the shade and hangs her head to cry

And she wonders how it ever got this crazy
She thinks about a boy she knew in school
Did she get tired or did she just get lazy
She's so far gone, she feels just like a fool


My, oh my, you sure know how to arrange things
You set it up so well, so carefully
Ain't it funny how your new life didn't change things
You're still the same old girl you used to be
