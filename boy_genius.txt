Boy Genius

In C (Capo II)

chorus chords

When the [D] boy genius looked in the [A] mirror
Boy [D] genius didn’t like what he [A] saw
He thought, “The [D] genius thing is [A] somewhat in question
And I [E] ain't even looking like a boy at all”
He had [D] gray hairs [A] poppin’ at the temples
[D] Gray half moons under [A] his red eyes
[D] Meanwhile [A] resting in a feather bed
[E] another boy genius with a new surprise

[G] Oh Lord, [A] don’t let ‘em find me
[G] Oh Lord, [A] don’t let ‘em find me
[G] Oh Lord, [E] don’t let ‘em find me [A] out

The big chief called his old buddy
Said, “Mike, I got a job for you.
I know you’ve messed up, hey we all mess up
But this is nothing hard to do.
Man, you get a six-figure salary, big leather chair
Starched shirts and sweet silk ties.”
Michael knew that he could jive his way through
If the Good Lord was willing and the creeks didn’t rise

Oh Lord, don’t let ‘em find me
Oh Lord, don’t let ‘em find me
Oh Lord, don’t let ‘em find me out

Pretty [E] sure that we can fool them for a week or two
[A] Maybe we can [D] fool them for a [A] year
[E] Maybe we can fool them for the rest of our lives
But… I don’t know

chorus chords

Was that the [D] whole dam busting or [A] just another leak
Is that a [D] fine antique or just [A] past the peak
Is that a [D] blush of shame or a [A] rosy cheek
Is that a [D] foolproof system or a [A] lucky streak
We got [D] dark sunglasses and [A] push-up bras
[D] Control-top pantyhose and [A] probable cause
We are [D] breaking the bank, we are [A] breaking the laws
We are [D] basking in the glow of [A] polite applause

And singin’ [G] “Oh Lord, don’t let ‘em [A] find me
[G] Oh Lord, [A] don’t let ‘em find me
[G] Oh Lord, [E] don’t let ‘em find me [A] out”
[E] Don’t let ‘em find me [A] out
[E] Don’t let ‘em find me [A] out
