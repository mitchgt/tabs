these need fixin ...

[C]Mom and Dad, x where have you gone?
I'm [F] here at your house, and I just mowed your lawn [G]
Ah,[C] but nobody's home now but me [F]
I [C] wonder just where you could be [G]

[chorus]:
[F]I know you're sposed to be [G]down in the [C]ground
but I'm not so sure if you're there[G]
[F]I get the feeling you're [C]closer around
Cause I still feel you in the [G]air
Yes I still feel you [C]everywhere

Mom and Dad, where are you at?
I'm getting your mail, and I'm petting your cat
Ah, but other than that, there's just me
I wonder just where you could be?

[chorus]

Mom and Dad, why don't you come out?
And show me your faces again
So much that I'd like to tell you about
And you could tell me where you've been
Yes I want to know where you've been
