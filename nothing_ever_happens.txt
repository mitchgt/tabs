capo on 5th Fret 


C                                                 Am 
Post office clerks put up signs saying position closed 
C                                                     Am 
And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats 

F                     C 
Janitors padlock the gates 
       G                 F  
For security guards to patrol 
F                               C 
And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink 
             G                    F 
While the married ones turn on a chat show 
C                             F                  C 
And they'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow 


C                                                 Am 
Gentlemen time please, you know we can't serve anymore 
C                                                             Am 
Now the traffic lights change to stop, when there's nothing to go 
F                                 C 
And by five o'clock everything's dead 
      G                  F 
And every third car is a cab 
F                                   C 
And ignorant people sleep in their beds 
G                                   F 
Like the doped white mice in the college lab 

C               F      C                  F 
Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all 
     Am                    F              
The needle returns to the start of the song 
G                            F 
And we all sing along like before 

C                          F                  C 
And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow 


Telephone exchanges click while there's nobody there 
The Martians could land in the carpark and no one would care 
Close-circuit cameras in department stores shoot the same movie every day 
And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed 
Just survive constant action replay 

 
Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all 
The needle returns to the start of the song 
And we all sing along like before 

And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow

Bill hoardings advertise products that nobody needs 
While angry from Manchester writes to complain about 
All the repeats on T.V. 
And computer terminals report some gains 
On the values of copper and tin 
While American businessmen snap up Van Goghs 
For the price of a hospital wing 


Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all 
The needle returns to the start of the song 
And we all sing along like before 
Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all 
They'll burn down the synagogues at six o'clock 
And we'll all go along like before 

And we'll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
