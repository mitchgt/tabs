Don't go back to Rockville

[E] Looking at your watch a third time
Waiting in the station for the [A] bus
[E] Going to a place that's far
So far away and if that's not [A] enough
[B] Going where no [A] body [G#m] says [C#m] hello
They don't talk to [Bm] anybody they don't [A] know

[E] You'll wind up in some factory
That's fulltime filth and nowhere left to [A] go
[E] Walk home to an empty house
Sit around at night all by your [A] self
[B] I know it might sound [A] strange but [G#m] I be [C#m] lieve
You'll be coming back be [Bm] fore too [A] long

[E] Don't go back to [F#m] Rockville [B]
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
[A] And waste another year

At night I drink myself to sleep
Pretend I don't care that you're not here with me
Cause it's so much easier to handle
All my problems if I'm too far out to sea
[B] But something better [A] happen [G#m] soon
Or it's [C#m] gonna be too late to [Bm] bring you [A] back

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another year

[E] It's not as though I really [A] need [B] you [A] [B]
If you were here I'd only bleed you
[F#m] But every [C#m] body else in [F#m] town only [C#m] wants to bring you [A] down
And that's how it ought to [B] be
I know it might sound [A] strange but [G#m] I be [C#m] lieve
You'll be coming back [Bm] before [A] too long

[E] Don't go back to [F#m] Rockville [B]
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another year

Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
Don't go back to Rockville
And waste another year
