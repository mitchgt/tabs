A Kiss is Not a Contract

[G] A kiss in not a [C] contract
But it's [D] very nice
Mm it's very nice
[G] Just because you've been [C] exploring my mouth
Doesn't [D] mean you get to take an expedition further south, no

[G] A kiss is not a [C] contract
But it's [D] very nice
It's very very nice
[G] Just because we've been [C] playing tonsil hockey
Doesn't [D] mean you get to score the goal that's in my Jockey's

[Em] Just because I'm in a two-man [D] novelty band
Doesn't mean it's all about [C] poontang
I can't go around loving [B] everyone
I just wouldn't get [A] anything done

[Em] You can take me out to dinner [D] that might be quite nice
You could buy me a burrito and some [C] beans and rice
But that won't get you into pants [B] paradise
They call it a fly because it takes you up to [A] heaven oh [G] woah
