So you're in [G] love with some one else
Some one who [Em] burns with in your soul
And it [C] looks like I [D] am the last to [G] know
I hear you've [G] never felt so alive
So much [Em] desire beyond control
and as [C] usual I [D] am the last to [G] know

The last to [G] know how you're [C] feeling
The last to [G] know where you [Em] are
The last to [C] know if you're [Am] happy
Or if he's [Bm] treating you like I treated you
Or if he's [C] cruel [D] I'll be the last to [G] know

We spent the summer out beyond the bay
and you said [Em] these are such perfect days
But if the [C] bomb drops baby I want [D] to be the [G] last to know
But now you're living up behind the hill
And though we [Em] share the same city and feel the same sun
When your [C] winter comes [D] I'll be the last to [G] know

The last to [G] know how you're [C] feeling
The last to [G] know where [Em] you are
The last to [C] know if you're [Am] happy now
Or if he's [Bm] pleaded with you like I pleaded with you if you [C] go
Don't [D] let me be the last to [C] know
Don't [D] let me be the last... to [G] know

[Am] Creation's gone [D] crazy [Am] TV's gone [G] mad
Now [Am] you're the only [C] sane thing that I [D] have

The last to [G] know how you're [C] feeling
The last to [G] know where [Em] you are
The last to [C] know if you're [Am] happy now
Or if he [Bm] cheating on you like I cheated on you ooh ooh [C] ooh

You were the [D] last to [C] know
you [D] were the last to [C] know
Don't [D] let be the last...... to [G] know
