(VERSE):(A)I don't remem(E)ber quite how I met (G)you (D)wasn't long ago

(A)Just get a pic(E)ture of sun,

in your(G) eyes. The waves in your hair(D) (A)

Maybe it's some(E)thing said in a mov(G)ie

or (D) you could've said last night. (A)

Just took me out(E) on a limb

And I don't(G) really know what I'm do(D)ing here.

Ê

(Em)And some(G)times I'm (Bm)caught in a land(D)slide

my (F#)beat's so in (A)time can you (C#)look at me

(Em)I'm out of reach I'll (Bm)talk if it feels right

(D)I've had my last (F)chance on the (G)stairway.

BRIDGE: A E G D

Ê

(VERSE):Funny it's just like a scene out of Voltaire twisting out of sight

'Cause when all the curtains are pulled back

We'll turn and see the circles we traced

Ain't no game... when you're playing with fire

It doesn't seem right that we fight

So the party runs on all night

Ê

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide

My beat's so in time can you look at me

I'm out of reach I'll talk if it feels right

So nervous to say tell me can't you see

If you want I'll fall out forever

I can't say no more... bebe dance with me

And please don't say leave till later

I've had my last chance on the stairway.

Ê

(VERSE):Wonder why...

what makes me rise so high

Maybe it's something they put in your perfume

Or the look in your eyes

It could be the atmosphere sinking

I don't even know what you're thinking

Don't even know what you're drinking

But it keep this heaven alive
