Pot Kettle Black

(transcribed by Steve Thomas)


Intro - D   G  (4X)
  
            D      G
Crazy rides rockets
                D   G
Who has a magic wand
               D      G
Empty out your pockets
                D   G
Words without a song

Em                    G              D    G
I myself have found a real rival in myself
Em                G                D     G
I am hoping for a re-arrival of my health

Sleeping eye sockets
Baby suck your thumb
I'll keep you in my locket
A string I never strum

It's become so obvious 
You are so oblivious to yourself

F  Em            D
You're tied in a knot
F#m     G             Em
But I'm not gonna get caught
          D          F#m
Calling a pot kettle black
Em             G
Every song's a comeback
Em               G
Every moment's a little bit later

Lazy locomotives
wherever you may roll
I think you have no motive
I know you have no home 

It's become so obvious 
You are so oblivious to yourself

You're tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song's a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
