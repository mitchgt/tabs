Forever And Ever Amen

Greatest Hits Part 2


D                  G           D
You may think that I'm talking foolish
       G                         D
You've heard that I'm wild & I'm free
    G                    D
You may wonder how I can promise you now
      E                           A
This love that I feel for you always will be
D               G              D
But you're not just time that I'm killing
    G                       D
I'm no longer one of those guys
    G                   D
As sure as I live this love that I give
    E                      A
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die  --  Oh baby



chorus...
D          G       D        G              D
I'm gonna love you forever, forever & ever amen
   G                      D
As long as old men sit & talk about the weather
   E                       A
As long as  the women sit & talk about old men
        D          G            D
If you wonder how long I'll be faithfull
         G                D
I'll be happy to tell you again
G          A          D       G     E        A    D
I'm gonna love you forever & ever, forever & ever Amen


                               G         D
They say that time takes it's toll on a body
           G                           D
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
     G                              D
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
          E                      A
And if it all fell out well I'd love you anyway
               D              G           D
They say time can play tricks on a memory
      G                             D
make people forget things that they knew
         G       A          D
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
       E                      A                         D
I've already forgotten every woman but you  ---  Oh darlin'


chorus......

      G        A             D
Just listen to how this song ends
G         A           D       G    E      A
I'm gonna love you forever & ever forever & ever
Bm        G    E         A      D
Forever & ever Forever & ever Amen
