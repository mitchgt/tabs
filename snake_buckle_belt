Snake Buckle Belt (Petty) 

[D]In the back of an [Am]old chest of drawers [G]
[D] I found my [Am] snake buckle belt [G]
[D] It held up my [Am]flared yellow cords [G]
[D] When my brother was [Am]Ringo
[G] And I was [D] George

And all of these [Am] loose ends that never get [G] tied
And all of these [C] old flames that never quite [G]died
And all of those [xx2000] grand plans that never came [A] true

[Cmaj7] Here's to your [D] health
I wear my [ ] snake buckle [ ]belt  
For [C]you
For [G]you

In the back of a church when I was twelve
I learned to smoke and play cards
I still wore my snake buckle belt
When I kissed a girl in the cold graveyard

And all of these loose ends that never get tied
And all of these old flames that never quite died
And all of that young love that never came true

Here's to your health
I wear my snake buckle belt
For you
For you

On the back of a torn tax return
I wrote a list of regrets
And I watched as the paper burned
'Cos I'll never forget 
But I'll never learn

That all of these loose ends never get tied
All of these old flames never quite died
So to both of my brothers
Whom I never outgrew

Here's to your health
I leave my snake buckle belt
To you
To you
