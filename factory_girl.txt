Note there is a little sort of picked riff played often throughout the song its
based on A G D movement. I tend to pick around an A to A7 change, then a G to Gm change,  finishing with a D releasing the top E string (Dsus2) and hammering back on the  second fret. It changes a little on repetition but is basically the same  progression. For the basis of the transcription we will call it "Riff 1"

Russ wrote in and suggested the following for the riff:
"I think that riff might be sliding the 3rd string from the 2nd to 4th fret,
then hitting the 2nd string on the third fret, then (maybe) pulling of the
2nd fret to open string on the third, fourth, and maybe fifth string, or
going straight into the "C" or "G" (root note) chord from the fourth
string. Just an idea, it sounds a lot like another riff I know." 

[G]So [Em]factory girl, she [A]listens for the [G]sound of her daddy's [Em]engine 'til the [A]work bell sounds and [D]she leaves town

Riff 1 twice 

[G]Know the summers [Em]here are  [A]hot, all she [G]seems to do is [Em]work and sleep and [A]wish that she was [D]still with you

Riff 1 twice 

[C]No you [G]don't know where she [D]is
Lying [C]in her mother's [G]bed
Or [C]who she's sleeping [G]with
 
Riff 1 x 4, then G Em A G Em A D 
Riff 1 x 4 or 5 times, all this over a harmonica. 

[G]All the [Em]kids would laugh at [A]her
Because [G]she seemed so sweet and [Em]pure
I [A7]took this shift be[D]cause of her 

Riff 1 x 2

[G]No I've [Em]never said a [A]word
I once [G]smiled and looked at [Em]her
'til the [A]shift boss said now get [D]back to work 

Riff 1 x 4 

[C]Now I [G]don't know where she [D]is
Or [C]who's bed she's sleeping [G]in
Or [C]what man she's sleeping [G]with 

Finish with picking over a D G repeated change

FACTORY GIRL, by Ryan Adams 
From the "In Your Wildest Dream" EP and the soon-to-be-re-released "Faithless 
Street" double-disc. 

Em1 and A1 mean this: do the regular chords, but keep your fourth finger on 
the second string third fret. So, Em1 = 022030 and A1 = X02230. You'll have to 
try out the D riff on your own. Here's how I do it: Get a regular D going, and 
pull off and on on the third string second fret, where your pointer finger is. 
It goes off and on once; then you hit the string right above that one; then 
you return to the third string second fret and slide it up to the fourth fret 
(using that noise it makes); then play the fourth string fourth fret; then 
back down to the third string, and back down to the regular D, capping it off 
with the high-E pull-on that makes the full D full. This probably sounds 
really screwy, but try it along with the sound and figure out a way that's 
comfortable for you. The main thing is the rhythm.

D riff four times 

VERSE 1:

for the sound of her daddy's engine 
A1 D 
till the work bell sounds and she leaves town. 

D riff twice

Lying in her mother's bed 
C9 G 
Or what man she's sleeping with. 

D riff four times 

VERSE 2 
G Em1 A1 
Oh, the kids will laugh at her 
G Em1 
Cause she seems so sweet and pure 
A1 D 
I took this shift because of her. 

D riff twice 

G Em1 A1 
Oh, I've never said a word

REPEAT CHORUS. 

Either repeat D riff four times to end, or end after the chorus (as Ryan 
sometimes does live). Have fun!
