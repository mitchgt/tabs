Take Me Down 

C                             G
I don't believe a word you're saying
                           F
And I know the game you're playing
                      G
So it's only just for now
                            C
That I will let you take me down

C                       G
You always manage to be low
                            F
So I don't have a chance to go
                        G
And it's just temporary now
                            Ab
That I will let you take me down

        C               Am
Pick me up on your way down
           C7                 Dm
Don't your feet ever touch the ground
                            Am
You know they never make a sound

Ab                            C
And if I should ever turn out right
                          Dm
Say my prayers most every night
                            G
Now wouldn't that just be a sight

C                          G
Now I aware I should know better
                       F
But I don't when we're together
                         G
I'll forgive myself somehow
                           C
And I will let you take me down

                     G
I can't hold on to myself
                        F
And hold on to somebody else
                        G
So if I hold on to you now
                            Ab                    
Then I will let you take me down

        C               Am
Pick me up on your way down
           C7                 Dm
Don't your feet ever touch the ground
                            Am
You know they never make a sound

Ab                            C
And if I should ever turn out right
                          Dm
Say my prayers most every night
                            G     F Am F Am F Am  G
Now wouldn't that just be a sight

Ab      C               Am

Don't your feet ever touch the ground
                            Am
You know they never make a sound

Ab                            C
