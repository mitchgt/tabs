Ashes of American Flags

Transcription by Dan Van Skiver <spacedog@goeaston.net>

Jeff was playing this live on his solo tour last year, so I kind of got a 
head start on learning this one. The record version is pretty much played 
the same way.

You may find this listed on live recordings as "Cash Machine". As with 
all my transcriptions, the lyrics are not necessarily correct (though this 
is one of the songs I'm more confident about lyrically). Feel free to make 
corrections.


intro:

g -----------------------------------------------
d ----0------------------------------2----------
a ----------0-----------------2------------------
e ---------------2-----3-------------------------

D                          G
The cash machine   is blue and green

D                                      G
For a hundred in twenties   and a small service fee

Em                                        A
I could spend three dollars     and sixty-three cents

D                            G
On diet coca-cola    and unlit cigarettes

D      G      D      G

Em                                                     A
I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a fuck

D                                  G
How hot and sorrowful, this machine begs for luck

F#m        G                    B
    All my lies are always wishes

Em                   A                            D     G       D        G
I know I would die if I could come back new


I want a good life with a nose for things
A fresh wind and bright sky to enjoy my suffering
A hole without a key if I'd break my tongue
Speaking of tommorrow, how will it ever come?

All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

I'm down on my hands and knees
Everytime the doorbell rings
I shake like a toothache
When I hear myself sing

All my lies are only wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

I would like to salute the ashes of american flags
And all the fallen leaves filling up shopping bags

The basic electric guitar riff that we hear throughout in the background is:

------5--------------
---------------------
------------8b7------
-7-------------------
---------------------
---------------------

where you bend up a half-step from the seventh fret before sounding the
note, then release the bend with the note still sounding

The chords:

D                 G
The cash machine, is blue and green
D                         G                    (walk down...)
For a hundred in twenties and a small service fee
Em                    A
I can spend 3 dollars and 63 cents
D                 G
On diet Coca Cola and unlit cigarettes

repeat progression 1x between verses

I wonder why we listen to poets and nobody gives a fuck
How hot and sorrowful this machine begs for luck


F#m          G               G/F#
      All my lies are always wishes
Em                   A                        D
      I know I would die if I could come back new


I want a good life with a nose for things
A fresh wind and bright skies To enjoy my sufferings
A hole without a key if I break my tongue
Speaking of tomorrow, how will it ever come
All my lies are only wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

I'm down on my hands and knees every time the doorbell rings
I shake like a toothache when I hear myself sing
All my lies are always wishes
I know I would die if I could come back new

I would like to salute the ashes of American flags
And all the falling leaves filling up shopping bags
