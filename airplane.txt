Airplane
(Peter Case)

(opening riff) [G] [A]

Out[A]side the coli[D]seum
We [G]stole the flying mac[Bm7]hine
[G]With your arms wrapped a[D]round my waist
[G]You took a ride with [A]me
Over [G] fields and rich green [D]forests
[G]Way out in the [Bm7]wilds
‘Til [G]we ran out of [D]gas and crashed
After [G]one last magic [A] mile [D]

CHORUS:
Won't you let me [A]ride
[G]on your air[Bm7]plane
[G]I’ve been living on a [D]landing strip
[G]Watching the run[A]way
[G]Everything in the whole wide world
Could flow so easi[Bm7]ly
[G]If you’d only come [D]down and fly and take an [G]airplane ride with [A]me[D]

We [A]came down through the [D]treetops and [G]hit the ground so [Bm7]hard
[G]I came to by a [D]picket fence in an [G]elderly couple’s [A]yard
[G]That's when you turned in[D]to a man
I [G]wanted to go [Bm7]back
Then we [G]saw the houndstooth [D]interior and [G]stole their Cadi[A]llac[D]

CHORUS

The po[A]liceman pulled us [D]over and [G]started to run a [Bm7]make
[G]Stealin' that Eldo[D]rado was [G]looking like a big [A]mistake
[G]He threatened jail and named the bail
I was broke and on a [Bm7]roll
On a [G]corner of God’s [D]highway I’d [G]never been be[A]fore[D]

CHORUS
