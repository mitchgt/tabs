Shake It Off

Am C  G

I stay out too [Am] late
Got nothing in my [C] brain
That's what people [G] say
That's what people [G] say

I go on too many [Am] dates
I can't make 'em [C] stay
At least that's what people [G] say
That's what people say

I keep [Am] cruisin'
Can't stop won't stop [C] moving
It's like I got this [G] music in my mind
Saying [G] it's gonna be alright

Cause the [Am] players gonna play
And the [C] haters gonna hate
Baby, [G] I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, I shake it off

Heart [Am] breakers gonna break
And the [C] fakers gonna fake
Baby, [G] I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off

I never miss a [Am] beat
I'm lightening on my [C] feet
And that's what they don't [G] see
That's what they don't see

Am  C   G

I'm dancing on my [Am] own
I'll make the moves up as I [C] go
That's what they don't [G] know
That's what they don't know

Am  C  G

Cause the [Am] players gonna play
And the [C] haters gonna hate
Baby, [G] I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, I shake it off

Cause the [Am] players gonna play
And the [C] haters gonna hate
Baby, [G] I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake

Baby, [Am] I'm just gonna shake
Baby, [C] I'm just gonna shake
Baby, [G] I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, Shake it off

Am  C  G

End on Am
