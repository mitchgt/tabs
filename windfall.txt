        G                          G/F#
Now and then it keeps you running
D
   Sometimes it just won't die
Bm
    Trail spent with fear
     C
Not enough living on the outside
G                          G/F#
    Never seem to get far enough
D
    Staying in between the lines
     Bm
Hold on to what you can
        C       G                C
Waiting for the end, not knowing when

CHORUS:
        G                             G/F#
May the wind take your troubles away
        D
May the wind take your troubles away
     C
Both feet on the floor
    G
Two hands on the wheel
        D                        G
May the wind take your troubles away

| G | G | D | D |

| C | G | D | G |

D
Trying to make it far enough
C                   G
   To the next time zone
        D
Few and far between past the midnight hour
C              G
   Never feel alone
       G/F#        Em
You're really not alone

VERSE 2:
Switching it over to A.M.,
Searching for a truer sound;
Can't recall the call letters,
Steel guitar, I settle down.
Catching an all-night station
Somewhere in Louisiana,
Sounds like 1963
But for now sounds like heaven.

        G              G/F#      Em
May the wind take your troubles away
        C
May the wind
                    G
Take your troubles away
