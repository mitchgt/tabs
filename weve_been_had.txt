We've Been Had

(Intro:)
G / / / C / G /

(Verse:)
C                     G       C       (E bass) G
There's a guitar leaning      on a Marshall stack
C       (B)            Am             G        D/F# bass
Used to sound like the sun on the horizon
      C                 G
Now I think We've been had

(repeat Intro)
There's a young girl screaming all the way in the back
Poor kid, she never saw it comin'
Now she knows, she's been had

(Bridge:)
G                   D
Watching the labels spinnin' on my turntable
        Em              (7)
There's no call waitin' in my headphones
    C                             Em                      Am
And every star that shines in the back of my mind is just waitin'
        C
For his cover to be blown

(repeat Intro)
There's an eardrum bleedin', yeah it's in my head
How could I still be so in love when I know
We've been had

Republicans, Democrats, can't give you the facts,
Your parents won't tell you till your grown,
And every star that shines in the back of your mind is just waitin'
For its cover to be blown

(Guitar solo over verse)

Flashing their badges just like the law of averages
No one likes 'em where they're from
And every star that hides on the back of the bus is just waiting
For his cover to be blown
