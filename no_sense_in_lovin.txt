D  Em  Bm  A  Em  A

I don't [D]know [G]what
[Bm]    You've been [Em]through
[Bm]    You might [D]think
That I [A]don't care
But [Em]I  do [D] [A]

And I've [D]tried to [G]understand
[Bm]  I've tried to [Em]understand
[Bm]  Your [D] abuse
But you've [A]got no
[Em]Excuse

And there's [A]no use in [D]lovin' [Em]
Anyone[A] who hates [D]themself [Em] [Bm] [A]

You keep coming back, so I hold you
For a little while
But I always go
When I can't take
Your sad smile

[same chords as verse 2]
'Cause I can't stand it when you get
So intense
And it's all a part
Of our bad
Inheritance

And there's no sense in lovin'
Anyone

Won't you [G]come back for a [F#m]while
You could [Bm]see exactly
[D]What you've always meant to [Am]me
But you don't want to [G]know
[Bm]You don't want [Em]to [A7]know


And you don't know what
I've been through
And if I think
You probably do

And there's no sense in lovin'
Anyone who hates themself
