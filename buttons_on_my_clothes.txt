Capo 3rd fret
Intro   C       Em       D        D        x2
     
              G                D                    C                             
I've been drinking all through summer I guess I've had a laugh
              G         D                C                       
I've had every kind of fun I could have had
       C           C           D
But looking at my crowd tonight
            G              D               C                     
There's a sober kind of sparkle in their eyes
                D
That I don't like

                   C        Em           D
Cause everybody knows she ain't coming back
                    C       Em                  D
The buttons on my clothes are as plain to see as that


I'm a man of reputation in this rockers town
I have lived it up so long I'll never live it down
Every backroom bet I've made
Every all night thrill room service bill I've paid
Looks cheap today

                   C        Em           D
Cause everybody knows she ain't coming back
                    C       Em                  D
The buttons on my clothes are as plain to see as that


          Am        C            Em    C
I took a chemical vacation in my hea………d
          Am            C                 Em              D          
Now I'm back here at the station with a trunk of regre…..

(solo) C   Em  D  D  x 2

I thought I'd found myself a frequency beyond her voice
But the memories keep breaking through the noise
So brother send a ship for me
Before I wash up on the shore of clarity
Where I can see……

(That) everybody knows she ain't coming back
The buttons on my clothes are as plain to see as that
Everywhere I go there are ghosts of what I had
Like the buttons on my clothes they are everywhere I'm at

She ain't coming back    
She ain't coming back
