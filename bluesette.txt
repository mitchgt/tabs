Bluesette
Toots Thielemans

Poor little sad little blue Bluesette
Don't you cry don't you fret
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken
And your blues will be forsaken
One lucky day lovely love will come your way

Long as there's love in your heart to share
Dear Bluesette don't despair
Some blue boy is longing just like you to
Find a someone to be true to
Two loving arms he can nestle in and stay

Pretty little Bluesette
Mustn't be a mourner
Have you heard the news yet
Love is around around the corner
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with big ribbon
To make your next springtime your gold wedding ring time
So dry your eyes don't you pout don't you fret
Goody good times are coming Bluesette 

Poor little sad little blue Bluesette
Don't you cry don't you fret
And your blues will be foresaken
One lucky day lovely love will come your way
That magic day may just be today
