G, Em, C, D (Shuffle progression)

(or C Am F G capo 2)

What a [G (C)] beautiful [Em (Am)] face I have found in this [C (F)] place
That is circling [D (G)] all around the sun
What a [G (C)] beautiful [Em (Am)] dream that can flash on the [C (F)] screen
In a blink of an [D (G)] eye, and can be gone from [G (C)] me
Soft and [Em (Am)] sweet let me [C (F)] hold it close and [D (G)] keep it here
let [G (C)] me [Em (Am)] [C (F)] [D (G)] 
[G (C)] And one day we will [Em (Am)] die and our ashes will [C (F)] fly 
from the airplane [D (G)] over the sea
[G (C)] But for now we are [Em (Am)] young
let us lay in the [C (F)] sun
And count every [D (G)] beautiful thing we can [G (C)] see
Love to [Em (Am)] be in the [C (F)] arms of all I'm [D (G)] keeping here
let [G (C)] me [Em (Am)] [C (F)] [D (G)]

What a curious life we have found here tonight
the is music that sounds from the street
there are lights in the clouds Anna's ghost all around
hear a voice as its rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet 
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Em                 C
Now how I remember you
                            G
How I would push my fingers through your mouth
                       D 
and make those muscles move
                                  Em
And make your voice so smooth and sweet
                              C    
And now we keep where we don't know
                            G
Our secrets sleep in winter clothes
                              D
With the one you love (b) so long ago
                           Em    C  G  D
No you don't even know your name

what a beautiful face I have found in this place
That is circling all around the sun
And when we meet on the cloud 
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing about everyone I see
Cant believe how strange it is to be anything
at all
