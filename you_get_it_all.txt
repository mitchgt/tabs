Chorus:
| D    | C  G  | Em D  |

All my tame and all my wild
All my man and all my child
All my faults and all my scars
All my sometimes lucky stars
All my joys and my regrets
All my old Guy Clark cassettes
I knew the night we met that you'd get it all

All my lows and all my highs
All my truth and all my lies
All my rights and all my wrongs
All my 'From now on' love songs
All my future all my roots
All my worn out cowboy boots
I kick off in the hall, you get it all

And I'd rather drive you crazy, being more than you can stand
Than to let you try to love half a man
All my cards are on the table and darlin' it's your call
I'm all in so lose or win you get it all

All my 'will be' all my 'was'
All my cloudy Texas dust
All my humble, all my braggin'
All my on and off the wagon
All my be your place to hide
All my always on your side
All my catch you when you fall, you get it all

And I'd rather drive you crazy, being more than you can stand
Than to let you try to love half a man
All my cards are on the table and darlin' it's your call
But I'm all in so lose or win you get it all

All my blessin' all my curse
All my better all my worse
From the chapel to the hearse, you get it all
Yeah you do
