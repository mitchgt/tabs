Hootie and the Blowfish 
Cracked Rear View 
1994 
This was Hootie's first single.  I guess this is one of those
goody-goody songs, but people liked it anyway.  Have fun! Chords 
Play the first note of the Bsus2 as a downstroke,
then play the second as an upstroke (thanks to
Roland from High Rise 1 for that suggestion).

INTRO (play twice for intro): Bsus2     E                         Bsus2     E

For the verses, play the rhythm figure. With a little love, and some tenderness
We'll walk upon the water
We'll rise above the mess
With a little peace, and some harmony
We'll take the world together
We'll take 'em by the hand 
PRE-CHORUS F#                   E        B
   'Cause I've got a hand for you
F#                E        B
   'Cause I wanna run with you 
Yesterday, I saw you standing there
Your head was down, your eyes were red
No comb had touched your hair
I said get up, and let me see you smile
We'll take a walk together
We'll walk the road awhile 
PRE-CHORUS 'Cause I got a hand for you
'Cause I wanna run with you CHORUS B    E  F#
Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
B    E  F#
Hold my hand
I'll take you to a place where you can be
B    E  F#
Hold my hand
Anything you wanna be because
E
   I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can 
See I was wasted, and I was wasting time
'Till I thought about your problems, I thought about your crimes
Then I stood up, and then I screamed aloud
I don't wanna be part of your problems
Don't wanna be part of your crowd, no 
PRE-CHORUS 'Cause I got a hand for you
'Cause I wanna run with you CHORUS Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to the promised land
Hold my hand
Maybe we can't change the world but
I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can 
GUITAR SOLO Play intro twice, then play pre-chorus. 
CHORUS (2x) Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to a place where you can be
Hold my hand
Anything you wanna be because
I...oh, oh no, no, no, no 

Hold my hand
Want you to hold my hand
Hold my hand
I'll take you to the promised land
Hold my hand
Maybe we can't change the world but
I wanna love you the best that, the best that I can play intro figure twice. The best that I can End on E
