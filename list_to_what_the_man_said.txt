Any time
Any day
You can hear the people say
That Love is blind
I don't know, but I say love is lind

Solider boy
Kisses girl
Leaves behind a tragic world
But he don't mind
He's in love and he says love is fine

Oh oh yes in deed we know
People find a way to go
No matter what the man said

Love is fine for all we know
For all we know our love will grow
That's what the man said
Won't you listen to what the man said

But he said

Oh oh yes in deed we know
People find a way to go
No matter what the man said

Love is fine for all we know
For all we know our love will grow
That's what the man said
Won't you listen to what the man said

The wonder of it all baby
The wonder of it all baby
The wonder of it all baby
yeah yeah yeah
