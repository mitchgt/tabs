1.
(G) We were marching down the orange plank road, when the federals first we (C) spied. (G)
By the (D) old Wilderness (G) Tavern, the (Am)armies did coll(C)ide.
Lead began to (G) fill & whistle through the (C)air.
The (G)dead & dyin' piled up, their (D) blood was everywhere.

Ch:
In the (C) Wilderness (G), I (Am) was just (C) seventeen.
By far the bloody (G) angle, was the (D) worst I'd ever seen.
In the (G) Wilderness....

2.
We broke in disorder & fled into the pines, tangled in the underbrush.
We could not find our lines, We faced em' there for hours.
It grew to dark to fight, and the groans & cries for water,
Went unanswered in the night.

Ch:
In the (C)Wilderness(G), in the (Am) early days of (C)June,
(G) lyin' with the dyin' neath the (D) green Virginia moon.
In the (C)Wilderness, where the (Am) devil tempted (C)Christ,
(G)we got on the radio & (D)ordered up a strike. In the (G) Wilderness.

Bridge:
So we (C) set the woods on (G) fire, (Am) stopped em' in their (C) tracks.
We (C) laughed as we saw em' (G) running (Am) shot em' in the (C) back.
They (C) never saw it (G) comin', from the (Am) guns up in the (C) trees.
So we (G) let em' have it one more time, as they (D) fell down on their knees. In the (C) Wilder(Em)ness. (D)(G)
(C)(G)(D)
(Em)(D)(G)
(F)(D)(G)

3.
I was way out in the Wilderness, with the Stonewall Brigade.
The captain saw my wound and said: "son, prayin' ain't my trade".
The jets went roaring over. We beheld the pride of mars.
With hearts the size of houses and eyes that blazed like stars.

Ch:
In the (C)Wilderness(G), where the (Am)serpent wears a (C)crown.
There were (G) angels in the treetops, as I (D) lay my body down.
In the (C) Wilderness (G), I (Am) was just (C) seventeen.
By far the bloody (G) angle, was the (D) worst I'd ever seen.
In the (G) Wilderness....
