 Am9     Am                Fmaj7
 Want to cross but I don't think I can
 Am9           Am        Fmaj7
 It's too weak here even where I stand
 Am9                      Am       Fmaj7
 Come here darling let me see you  hold my hand
           Am9              Am        Fmaj7
 So we can mend your broken halo
 G               Fmaj7
 All I want from you
 G               Fmaj7
 All I want from you  is for you to
 G    Fmaj7     G     Fmaj7    Am  Fmaj7   Am Fmaj7
 Turn around    Turn  around
 Am9     Am             Fmaj7
 Want to damage    so I damaged it some
 Am9               Am        Fmaj7
 We use to have it all now I just got some
 Am9                  Am                   Fmaj7 
 Silent perfections   mystery  all easy to fall from your lips
         Am9             Am              Fmaj7 
 All the while  lies are told to me  in shapeless secrets
 G                F
 All I want from you
 G               F
 All I want from you  is for you to
 G    F         G     F        
 Turn around    Turn  around
 G    F       G    F
 Turn around  turn around
