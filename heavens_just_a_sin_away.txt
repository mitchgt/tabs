Kelly Willis    Heaven's Just A Sin Away  written by Jerry Gillespie

D                            G                
Heaven's just a sin away  oh woa  just a sin away

D                          E                A7
I can't wait another day I think I'm givin' in

D                                 G 
How I'd long to hold you tight Oh woa be with you tonight

D                                     A7          D
That still don't make it right 'cause I belong to him

   G                       D        
Oh way down deep inside  I know that it's all wrong

     G                        A7                    
Your eyes keep tempting me  I never was that strong

D                     G                        
Devil's got me now Oh woa gone and got me now

D                          E                A7
I can't fight him anyhow I think he's gonna win

D                           G
Heaven's just a sin away Oh woa just a sin away

D                           A7               D
Heaven help me when I say I think I'm givin' in      
 

SOLO

   G                       D        
Oh way down deep inside  I know that it's all wrong

     G                        A7                    
Your eyes keep tempting me  I never was that strong

D                     G                        
Devil's got me now Oh woa gone and got me now

D                          E                A7
I can't fight him anyhow I think he's gonna win

D                           G
Heaven's just a sin away Oh woa just a sin away

D                           A7               D
Heaven help me when I say I think I'm givin' in      

A7               D
Think I'm givin' in  

A7               D
Think I'm givin' in
