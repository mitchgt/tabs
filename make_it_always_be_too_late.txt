make it always be too late 
(Currie) 
Capo on 4th fret


Intro
| Em | Bm | Em | Em | Em |  Bm | Am | Bm

       C      Bm          Em
What I want is everything to clear
               Am        Bm
So let the clocks be wrong 
        G     G/F#   Em      C       Bm      Am Em Bm
Let the evening be longer let me drown in here 


              C         Bm             Em
'Cause what I want gets clouded by the sun 
        Am       Bm
I can't see beyond 
    G     G/F#        Em      C           Bm     C 
The petty things that living here brings everyone 
      Em         G           Am
So get lost with me, let the whole world wait 
          C    D     Em    C
Make it always be too late 
(C)             D     G     Bm Am Bm
Make it always be too late 


              C       Bm              Em
'Cause what I want is right before my eyes 
          Am      Bm
So set me up a drink 
            G     G/F#    Em        C        Bm      Em
Pull the shutters down on all those prying satellites 
           Bm                             Em
'Cos what I want is everything to clear 
             Am          Bm
So if you stop your watch 
          G            G/F#  Em    C         Bm       C
You might stop the morning's cruel hammer falling here 
      Em         G           Am
So get lost with me, let the whole world wait 
          C    D     Em    C
Make it always be too late 
 (C)           D      G  Em G Em    G    Em  G Em G
Make it always be too late...    Too Late
