I wish I had an honest partner for some honest lessons,
Where you won't be judged for your small transgressions
And nobody cares when we come or go.

I wish I had a trusted comrade who I could care for,
Making this the one who was always there for
My favorite one at the show.

And how do you let someone go that you've never had?
That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.

I'm hoping that the day will come when I can tell you
All the things I've always meant to,
And then you'll finally know.

And I won't be sorry, but it won't be easy.
You can see in my eyes it's alright to believe me
And this ain't all blow.

And how do you let someone go that you've never had?
That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.
And how do you let someone go that you've never had?
That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.
That'd be a hell of a trick.

I feel like a sold back record, like a constant leap year,
Spinning months by like I'll always be here.
But I'm so out of time.

And how do you let someone go that you've never had?
That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.
And how do you let someone go that you've never had?
That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.
That'd be a hell of a trick.

And how do you let someone go that you've never had?
That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.
That'd be a hell of a trick.
And how do you let someone go that you've never had?
That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.
That'd be a hell of a trick.

That'd be a hell of a trick, I know.
