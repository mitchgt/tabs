Notes : Ermm its D A G... with a cunning G D for the line
"Says I haven't gone too far".. and thats it

Intro D A G

[D]I dreamed about killing you [A]again last night
[G]And it felt alright to me
[D]Dying on the banks of [A]Embarcadero skies
[G]I sat and watched you bleed
[D]Buried you alive in a [A]fireworks display
[G]Raining down on me
[D]Your cold, hot blood ran [A]away from me
To the [G]sea

D A G D A G

I printed my name on the back of a leaf
And I watched it float away
The hope I had in a notebook full of white dry pages
Was all I tried to save
But the wind blew me back via Chicago
In the middle of the night
And all without fight
At the crush of veils and starlight

D A G D A G

I know I'll make it back
One of these days and turn on your TV
To watch a man with a face like mine
Being chased down a busy street
When he gets caught I won't get up
And I won't go to sleep
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Via Chicago

D A G D A G

Where the cups are cracked and hooked, above the sink
They make me think
Crumbling ladder tears don't fall
They shine down your shoulders
Crawling is screw faster lash
I blow it with kisses
Rest my head on a pillowy star
And a cracked door moon
[G]Says I haven't gone too [D]far

D A G D A G

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Via Chicago

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Via Chicago

Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Via Chicago

Addition to Via Chicago:

Here's the guitar lick that comes and goes throughout the song. Use lots of distortion to get the guitar feeding back (but you were going to do that anyway, right?:)
