Tupelo
Capo 2

| G . . D | C | G . . D | C |

Haven't been wasted in a long time
But tonight it feels just fine
Riding home with windows up
Alone with a plastic cup of real good wine

When I get out of this hole I'm goin' to Tupelo
There's a girl down there that'll treat me fair
Get about a week of spring and the summer is blistering . . .
There ain't no one from here that'll follow me there . . .
No, there ain't no one from here that'll follow me there

She said there's nothin' left to talk about
And at my age I should've figured out . . .
Which drawer to put the good knives in
The war between weekends tore our playhouse down

Kept her close, and way too close to me
She never lived up to my memory
Drivin' fast with the windows down
A past I don't belong to now, a mystery  . . .

When I get out of this hole I'm goin' to Tupelo
There's a girl down there that'll treat me fair
Get about a week of spring and the summer is blistering . . .
So, there ain't no one from here that'll follow me there . . .
No, there ain't no one from here that'll follow me there

When I get out of this hole I'm goin' to Tupelo
There's a girl down there that'll treat me fair
Get about a week of spring and the summer is blistering . . .
There ain't no one from here that'll follow me there . . .
Well, there ain't no one from here that'll follow me there
