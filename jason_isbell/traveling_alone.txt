Traveling Alone 
Jason Isbell

capo II

[Am] x 4

[Am] Mountains rough this time of [F] year
Close the [C] highway down
They don't [G] warn the town

I've been fighting second gear
15 miles or so
Tryin to beat the angry snow

[Em] And I know every town worth [Dm] passing through
But what good does [C] knowing do
With no one to [G] show it to

<chorus>
And I've grown [C] tired of traveling alone
[G] Tired of traveling alone
I've [Am] tired of traveling alone
Won't you [F] ride with me

I've grown tired of traveling alone
Tired of traveling alone
I've grown tired of traveling alone
Won't you ride with me

Won't you [C] ride
Won't you [G] ride
</chorus>

I quit talking to my self
Listening to the radio
A long long time ago

Damn near strangled by my appetite
Ybor City on a Friday night
Couldn't even stand up right

So high the street girls wouldn't take my pay
Said come see me on a better day
She just danced away

<chorus/>

<bridge>
[Am] Painting the outside 
lane I'm tired of answering [G7] to my [C] self

[Am] Hard like the rebuilt
part I don't know how much [G7] it's got [C] left
How much it's got [G] left
</bridge>

[C] [C] [G] [G] [Am] [Am-G] [F] [F]

<chorus/>
