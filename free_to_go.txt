Baby, now I understand how time can alter any plan

That love only pauses for awhile and is always free to go

Honey, I learned not to seek any promise hearts must keep
After mine had come to know and disappointedly so
That love only pauses for awhile and is always free to go

At every fading glance

I reach to take it in my hands

And if that touch might be the one, the one last chance

And though all those distant dreams seldom turn out what they seem
In the rush to let them grow, their loss has taught me to know
That love only pauses for awhile and is always free to go

Baby, now I understand how time can alter any plan
Then gently lead you to know truth hopes lies will never show
That love only pauses for awhile
And is always free to go

Yeah, love only pauses for awhile
And is always free to go
