Chaos and Clothes
Capo 5

[: C | C C/B | Am | Am :]

The ground was [C] wet and the [C/B] sky was [Am] dark
You took her [C] bet and she [C/B] took your [Am] heart [Am/G]
[F] Wrapped it 'round an oak tree like you
[C] Did that '67 [G] GTO
Oh [F] no [Fsus2] [F]

Lovers [C] leave [C/B] chaos and [Am] clothes
In quiet [C] corners where you [C/B] rarely [Am] ever [Am/G] go
[F] One day you find proof that she was
[C] Real despite your struggle to [G] forget
Oh [F] yes [Fsus2] [F]

[Em] You're in a [Fm] fight to the [C] death my friend
[Em] Black metal [Fm] t-shirts your [C] shield
[Em] You've got the [Fm] past on your [C] breath my friend
Now [G] name all the monsters you've [F] killed
Let's [G] name all the monsters you've [F] killed [Fsus2] [F] 

The man she [C] chose to [C/B] take your [Am] place
Wears his [C] collar up to [C/B] better frame his [Am] face [Am/G]
[F] How you'd love to hate her but you
[C] Just can't hate somebody you [G] don't know
Oh [F] no  [Fsus2] [F] 

Did she [C] leave a [C/B] trail of [Am] crumbs
So you could [C] find her when you're what you [C/B] could [Am] become [Am/G]
Or [F] did she know you well enough
To [C] realize that garden just won't [G] grow?
Oh [F] no [Fsus2] [F] 

[Em] You're in a [Fm] fight to the [C] death my friend
[Em] Airwaves a [Fm] grand battle [C] field
[Em] You've got the [Fm] past on your [C] breath my friend
Now [G] name all the monsters you've [F] killed
Let's [G] name all the monsters you've [F] killed [Fsus2] [F] 

| Em Fm | C C/B | Em Fm | C C/B | Em Fm | C C/B |
| G G/A | F | G G/A | F | F

In my [C] sleep I [C/B] build [Am] machines, but nobody
[C] ever wants to [C/B] hear about my [Am] dreams [Am/G]
Last [F] night I saw a burning Ferris [C] Wheel
The meaning's any [G] body's guess
Oh [F] yes [Fsus2] [F]

Lovers [C] leave [C/B] chaos and [Am] clothes
More [C] debris that you can sort through [C/B] in one [Am] go [Am/G]
[F] You say love is hell, but it's the
[C] Ghost of love that's made you such a [G] mess
Oh [F] yes [Fsus2] [F] 

[Em] You're in a [Fm] fight to the [C] death my friend
[Em] Fight like you're [Fm] chained to the [C] wheel
[Em] You've got the [Fm] past on your [C] breath my friend
Now [G] name all the monsters you've [F] killed
Let's [G] name all the monsters you've [Fm] killed [C]
