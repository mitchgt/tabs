Intro: G

Verse 1:
(G)           D        C               G
Blue Kentucky highway, headin' for the line
                  D                       C                         G
She hadn't said a word all night, but the wheels are turning in her mind
                 C                                   G
Now I was ridin' shotgun, and I knew things had gone awry
                    A
Just as soon as she dropped me off at the side of the road
        D
And she let that gravel fly

Chorus:
(D)                    G
Now I'm walking in the moonlight
                       C
Seein' nothin' but the taillights
G                Em
That's a pair of taillights
      A         D
I may never see again
                  G
She hit me with a left and right
                           C
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights
G               Em          A 
That's about as lonely as a highway has ever been
C                 D                G
Back here with my thumb out in the wind

Verse 2:
(G)                     D           C                     G
Was it something that I did to her, or the things I never said
                D           C              G
I wonder if the way we were was only in my head
                      C                                 G
Now if I even make it back to town before the sun comes up
              A
I'm gonna hit every parking spot around
        D
'Till I find that pickup truck

Repeat Chorus

Bridge:
(G)       C
Well I'll bet right now she's laughin' at how
    A
She brought me to my knees
        C                                       D
But she won't be laughin' half as loud when she gives me back my keys

Repeat Chorus
