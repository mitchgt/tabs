 If someone works on the lyrics, it'd be great !!!

Tampa To tulsa

It’s my favorite, so I tried to find the words, but i was too lazy, and I’m French so it doesn’t help, anyway. I’ve got the chords:

INTRO:

--------------
-3--3--3--3---
-0--0--0--0---
-0--2--4--2---
-x--x--x--x---
3—-3--3--3----

For the verses, it’s the same beginning, but then play a Csus2 and Dsus2, that is to say:
Csus2 (x32000)
Dsus2 (xx0230)

When tim starts crying “Tampa To Tulsa”: Em Bm A C

The progression btwn A and C is:

--0-----0—
--2-----1-
--2-----0-
--2-----2-
--0-0h2-3-
--x-----x-

And on “Please don’t ask, etc.” play: G G/F# Am C Dsus2 C Dsus2 (2x)

CONCLUSION:
Verses: Stuff with G
 Csus2 Dsus2 (2x)

Bridge : Em Bm
 A C

Chorus : G G/F# Am ]2x
 C Dsus2 C Dsus2 ]

 Marc, it looks like we're the only people with the new Jayhawks album! Anyway, great job on the chord progressions. I noticed the G riff is somewhat of a "Bass-strum-bass-strum" kind of pattern, but it was too much work to put it in there. Here's the words with your chords.

Standard tuning:

Chords:
Dsus2: xx0320
Csus2: x32000
G/F#: 2x0030 (at least in this song)


“Two… Three…” (tap on acoustic guitar body)

[G Riff]: 
---------------
-3--3--3--3---
-0--0--0--0---
-0--2--4--2---
-x--x--x--x---
-3--3--3--3---

G Riff
Tampa to Tulsa, just one layover
Csus2 Dsus2
Think it over

G Riff
Card game in the back seat, throwing dice in the aisle
Csus2 Dsus2 Csus2 Dsus2
And the driver just smiles at every mile -- he’s closer to the young little women who loves him

Em Bm A C
Tampa to Tulsa, one layover
G G/F# Am C Dsus2 C Dsus2
Please don’t ask take my love and make it last
G G/F# Am C Dsus2 C Dsus2
Please don’t ask, ease my worried mind and take my hand

G Riff
G Riff
Picking up nothing but stock quotes on a G.I.’s radio
Csus2 Dsus2 Csus2 Dsus2
It’s giving me nothing but false hope putting it all on the line

Em Bm A C
Tampa to Tulsa, one layover
G G/F# Am C Dsus2 C Dsus2
Please don’t ask take my love and make it last
G G/F# Am C Dsus2 C Dsus2
Please don’t ask, ease my worried mind and take my hand

A Dsus2 
I know that you’re running
A Dsus2
But you don’t know what from

Em Bm A C
Tampa to Tulsa, one layover
G G/F# Am C Dsus2 C Dsus2
Please don’t ask take my love and make it last
G G/F# Am C Dsus2 C Dsus2
Please don’t ask, ease my worried mind and take my hand

End with G Riff and then an arpeggiated G.

 hey guys great tabs but the words are a bit off

And the driver just smiles at every mile -- he’s closer to the young little women who loves him????????

Tampa to Tulsa, just one layover
thinking it over
there's a card game in the back seat
They're throwing dice in the aisle
And the driver just smiles
with every mile he's closer to the arms 
of the woman who loves him
Tampa to Tulsa, one layover

please don't ask, take my love and make it last
please don't ask, ease my worried mind
and take my hand

picking up nothing but stock quotes
on a GI's radio
it's giving me nothing but false hope
i'm putting it all on the line
Tampa to Tulsa, one layover

Cheers, 
Chris from AUSTRALIA

 Thanks for the good work guys - a great acoustic tune.

I prefer to play the bridge(?) part that goes "I know that you're runnin'..."

Am Bm
I know that you're running
Am Bm D 
 But you don't know what fro- om
Em
Tampa to Tulsa...

Give it a go and see if it sounds a little closer to the recording.

Hi, I'm new to this, but have used this web site many times.

all I can say is thanks to alt country music. Changed my musical outlook entirely!

I wanted to say thanks to anyone who has had any input in posting any Jayhawks and Wilco tabs, and many others on this site. This is my favourite site by far, and I promise I will be posting my own tab here very shortly!!!

thanks to everyones effort on Tampa to Tulsa! Specially HiFivinMoFo, and Maclothier, together almost the perfect tab! just a couple of geeky additions!

in the chorus, it may help to add a jingly jangly thing by taking your first finger on and off the Am chord to avoid switching to the C too quickly. Maybe switch to a proper D major after the Dsus2. And then at the end of the last line of the chorus throw in a G major!

anyway, Thank you. Please check out my band, theayes.com. Jersey Shore, folk country rock!
