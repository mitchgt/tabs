                E(2)                    A
You sent greetings from Liverpool 
                        E(2)    A
and I took the next train 
            E(2)                             A
Passed by people putting flowers on graves and
        A/G# 
We got delayed 
                                E(2)
When I arrived you had vanished like steam 
     A                          E(2)    A
and left me in a diesel day 
   E(2)                 A
So I walked around and spent ten pounds 
   A/G#
in amusement arcades 
                     B
Felt like I was in a field 

looking for a pin 
E               A
It's a kind of loneliness 
E               A
It's a kind of emptiness 
    E                           A
But I'm not trying I'm just rehearsing 
                        B
For the perfect day 

E        A              E                       A
When I want you, I'll come looking for you 
E        A              E                       A
When I want you, I'll come looking for you 
        F#min           A               F#min
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will
        A               E       A
Yes I will, yes I will

I took a spoon to the swimming pool 
to drain your trace away 
And I changed my name so only my looks remain 
And if looks could kill I'd need a license for my face 
'Cos where his fists put bruises 
A scheming smile now takes their place 

Felt like I was in a field 
looking for a pin 

It's a kind of loneliness 
It's a kind of emptiness 
But I'm not trying I'm just rehearsing 
For the perfect day 

When I want you, I'll come looking for you 
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will.
