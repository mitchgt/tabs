Bm
I wish

          Bm
I wish my baby was born

                      D
sittin' on his papa's knee

G
and you poor girl

      Bm
were dead and gone

G
green grass growin' over thee

Bm
not no saint

         D
nor I never shall be

G
till a sweet apple grows

          Bm
from a sour apple tree

Bm
I still hope

D
the day will come

G
when you and I

        Bm
will walk as one

Bm  D  G

(over and over and out)
