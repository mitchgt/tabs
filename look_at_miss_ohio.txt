Look at Miss Ohio
capo II

F C G Am G

[F] Oh me oh [C] my oh, [G] look at Miss [Am] Ohio [G]
She’s [F] running around with her [C] rag top [G] down
She says I [F] wanna do right but [C] not right [G] now

Gonna [F] drive to [C] Atlanta [G] and live out this [Am] fantasy [G]
[F] Running around with the [C] rag top [G] down
Yeah I [F] wanna do right but [C] not right [G] now

[Am] [D] [Am] [D]

Had your arm around her shoulder, a regimental soldier
An’ mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah you wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's a-runnin' around with the rag top down
She says I wanna do right but not right now

Am D Am D
F C G Am G
F C 

I know all about it, so you don’t have to shout it
I’m gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now

Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She a-runnin' around with her rag-top down
She says I wanna do right, but not right now
Oh I wanna do right but not right now
