Cemetery Savior

[E] You could change your [A] ways
[E] Living long enough to [A] stay
But you're [D] leaving when the day [A] breaks
Your [D] proving ground is [E] strange
Your [D] proving ground is [A] strange [G] [D]

[A] No pain [E] no need to [A] blink
You say it's [D] better when you don't [A] think
You like to [D] live on the dark [E] side
You like to [D] live on the [A] dark [G] side [D] [A] [G] [E]

A reflection of [A] one
A [E] lifetime with nothing to [A] hide
Just don't [D] ask what you do for a [A] living
No one [D] here says what they [E] mean
No one [D] here says what [A] they [G] mean [D] [A] [G] [E]

She always takes it [A] easy
Never thinks [E] twice
Behind the [D] scenes is where you [E] are
