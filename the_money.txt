The Money

He's for the sailboat
He's for the sea
He's for Betty Ford
He's for anarchy
He'll die for his country
He'll stick a flag in your soul
He'll jump on your sandcastle
He'll drown in your moat
He's for the money
And he just wants to sleep with me
He's for the money
He just wants to sleep with me

She tries too hard
She doesn't try at all
She'll push you over
She'll break your fall
She puts it out
She reels it in
She makes immaculate love
She makes original sin
She's for the money
She just wants to sleep with me
She's for the money
And she just wants to sleep with me

She's missing the notes but she hears the strain
She knows she's been strung
But she looks for change

He's for the birds
He's for all living things
I'm lost for words
I don't believe in things
I'm for the money
I just want to sleep with me
I'm for the money
I just want to sleep with me
