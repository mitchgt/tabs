Bennie and the Jets

[Am7] Hey kids, [D] shake it loose together
The [G] spotlight's hitting something
That's been [G7b9] known to change the weather
[Am7] We'll kill the fatted [D] calf tonight
So [Em] stick around
[Am] You're gonna hear electric [Bm] music
Solid [C] walls of sound

Say, [G] Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
[Am7] But they're so spaced out, [C7] Bennie and the [C] Jets
[G] Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
[Am7] Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got [C] electric boots a [D] mohair suit
You know I [Em] read it in a magazine [C]
[Bb/C] Bennie and the [G] Jets [F]

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Bennie and the Jets

Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet

Bennie and the Jets

Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the jets
Bennie, Bennie and the jets
