I'm Gonna Miss Her

        G
Well I love her
C        
And I love to fish
    D
I spend all day out on this lake
    G             D
And hell is all I catch
      G          
But today she met me at the door
     C               
Said I would have to choose
     G        D      Em  
If I hit that fishin hole today
G        D	Em
She'd be packin all her things
    C                D
And she'd be gone by noon


Chorus
               C
Well I'm gonna miss her
           G
When I get home
          D        
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
        G
And I'm sittin in the sun
               C
I'm sure it'll hit me
       G                 D       Em
When I walk through that door tonight
               C
Yeah I'm gonna miss her
           D                 G
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite


Interlude (play chorus chords)


B                    Em
Now there's a chance if I hurry
C       D          G
I could beg her to stay
B
But that water's right
        Em
And the weather's perfect
C                       D
No tellin' what I might catch today


             C
So I'm gonna miss her
           G
When I get home
          D        
But right now I'm on this lakeshore
        G
And I'm sittin in the sun
               C
I'm sure it'll hit me
       G                 D       Em
When I walk through that door tonight
               C
Yeah I'm gonna miss her
           D              G
Oh, lookie there, another bite


               C
Yeah I'm gonna miss her
           D                 G
Oh, lookie there, I've got a bite.

Enjoy!
