Help Me Suzanne

G C Am G

[G] Help me Suzanne I gotta figure it out
Why the [Am] whites of my eyes are red
[C] What I wouldn't give for a bed or a fire or a [G] phone
Who could I call what would I say
I've been [Am] working all week for you
[C] Where would I go to even if I could go [G] home

I've been [C] living on the memory of the dream I once had

[G] You gave me the [Em] reason for [Am] feeling like I [C] do
[G] You gave me the [Em] reason I'd like to [C] thank you

[G] Help me Suzanne I got to set my sights
On a [Am] bright sun shiny day
Cause [C] my whole world's gone gray and it's going [G] wrong
You got a big heartbeat and a body of work
You could [Am] do me a world of good
Yeah you [C] could and you did and I'm begging you to keep [G] on

I've been [C] living on the memory of the dream I once had

[G] You gave me the [Em] reason for [Am] feeling like I [C] do
[G] You gave me the [Em] reason I'd like to [C] thank you
[G] I had lost my [Em] way [Am] like I always [C] do
[G] You gave me the [Em] reason I'd like to [C] thank you
