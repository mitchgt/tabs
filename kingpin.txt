I wanna be your kingpin,
G          C/G      G     
living in............ Pekin.
I wanna be your bigwig, living in Pekin.
I caught the flu and away I flew.
N.Y.C., pediate blue.
Dimeatap, and spinal tap, a-city maps, and hand claps.
Statue of liberty play, it only works once, don't throw it away.
Cause I wanna be your kingpin, living in Pekin
Living in Pekin, livin in....
How can I, how can I give my love to you when I don't know what to do.
