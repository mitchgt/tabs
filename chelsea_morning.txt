Woke up it was a Chelsea morning and the first thing that I heard 
        G              Dmaj7          G6+9/D             D
Was a song outside my window and the traffic wrote the words 
          G               Dmaj7              G6+9/D        Dsus4addE
It came ringing up like Christmas bells and rapping up like pipes and drums
   D7sus4                 Dsus4addB   
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
         Dsus4/F Dsus4/E    D
And we'll wear it till the night comes

D Dsus4addB  D

Woke up it was a Chelsea morning and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains and a rainbow on my wall
Red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal bells to beckon
Oh, won't you stay? We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

D Dsus4addB  D     D  Bm7(addAb)/D  D

G               Dmaj7       G6+9/D      D
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
         G                      Dmaj7     
And the streets are paved with passers by 
     G6+9/D         Dmaj7 
And pigeons fly and papers lie  
G              G6+9/D   
Waiting to blow away

D7sus2  B7+9  D7sus2  B7+9  D7sus2  D(2)

Woke up it was a Chelsea morning and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges too
And the light pured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay? we'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

D  Dsus4/BD   D  Bm7(addAb)/D  D

 G              Dmaj7            G6+9/D       D
When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
        G               Dmaj7
I will bring you incense owls at night 
G6+9/D               Dmaj7          G              A
By candle light, by jewel light if only you will stay
      Dmaj7  G6+9/D
Pretty baby won't you 
D7sus2                   D(2)
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning
