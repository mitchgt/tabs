Horse and Crow
Peter Case

[G]Horse and Crow were some [C]pretty good friends
[G]Livin’ from the same suitcase[C]
[G]They spoke in tongues, people couldn’t [C]understand
[G]That’s the way it was back in [C]those days

[G]All that summer long they were [C]drivin’ through the South,
[G]Charming oblivion, they were[C] livin’ hand to [G]mouth
They were [C]careless then, [D]and the road stretched on and [G]on

[C]Well it’s a wonder and shame
[D]All those careless days have [G]gone.
Well it’s a [C]wonder and shame
[D]All those careless days have [G]gone.

First this happened and that happened and everything changed
Crow she flew off in a straight line
Leaving Horse who took some job makin’ 20 bucks a day
For some reason started looking for a sign

Well now everywhere he looked everything was white
Sometimes he thought he saw something moving in the night
They were careless then, and the road stretched on and on

Well it’s a wonder and shame
All those careless days have gone.
Well it’s a wonder and shame
All those careless days have gone.

[solo] [G]-[C]-[D]-[C] (etc.)

Seemed like eons but you could measure it in weeks
Crow’s horse sense was dead
Passing through the capitals of the western world unleashed
She was heading for Las Vegas to put everything on red
This world sets a price on love the kind you can’t forget
Well the ending of this story well it hasn’t happened yet

Well it’s a wonder and shame
All those careless days have gone.
Well it’s a wonder and shame
All those careless days have gone.

Well it’s a wonder and shame
How their road stretched on and on
They were careless then
Now those careless days have gone.
They were careless then
Now those careless days have gone.
