The Life You Chose
Capo 2

[: F Am G :]

[F] Who are [C] you if not the one I [G] met
[F] One July [C] night before the town went [G] wet
[F] Jack and [C] Coke in your mama's [G] car
You were reading The [F] Bell Jar [C] [G] 

[F] Where are [C] you if you're not on your [G] own?
[F] You're always [C] lonely, never quite alone [G]
[F] Where's the [C] Jesus that you swore you'd [G] find
After running the [F] last line [D] [A]

[G] Are you living the life you chose
[BmAre you living the life that chose you?
Are you taking a grown-up dose?
Do you live with a man who knows you like I
Thought I did back then
Oh, but I guess I never did
Did I, kid?

I got lucky when I finished school
Lost three fingers to a faulty tool
Settled out of court, I'm no one's fool
You probably knew
There's plenty left to make a getaway
We've spent enough nights in the bluegrass state
We could go somewhere where people stay up late
Or just somewhere new

Are you living the life you chose?
Are you living the life that chose you?
Are you taking a grown-up dose?
Do you live with a man who knows you like I
Thought I did back then
Oh, but I guess I never did
Did I, kid?

Here I am inviting you to throw your life away
Victim of nostalgia maybe take away
Just tonight I realized I am still in your backseat
Nothing I've had since has meant a thing to me

Are you living the life you chose?
Are you living the life that chose you?
Are you taking a grown-up dose?
Do you live with a man who knows you like I
Thought I did back then
Oh, but I guess I never did
Did I, kid?
