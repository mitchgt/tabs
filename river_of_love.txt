D
Well you can test the water now it ain't no sin
A
Sometimes it's better just to dive right in
G A                 D 
  Into the river of love
D
There ain't no need for you to cast your line
A
My heart's the only treasure you will find
G A                  D
  Out on the river of love
A
Well the river of love where no lights shine
        G                             D
But the flame of love you put in this heart of mine
A
You can spend your life wishin' on the stars above
           Bm
Or you can take your chances
G      A        D
On the river of love
D
There ain't no anchor that can tie us down
A
We'll sail forever never run aground
G A                    D
  Out  On the river of love
D
There ain't no storm that you can't overcome
A
There are no heartaches that can steal you from
G A                 D
  From the river of love

SOLO

D
Let's stay on board and ride it till the end
A
You never know just what's around the bend
G      A        D
Out On the river of love
D
There ain't no need for you to cast your line
A
My heart's the only treasure you will find
G A                    D
  Find on the river of love
A
Well the river of love where no lights shine
        G                             D
But the flame of love you put in this heart of mine
A
You can spend your life wishin' on the stars above
           Bm
Or you can take your chances
G      A        D
On the river of love
             Bm            D 
The River of love river of love
