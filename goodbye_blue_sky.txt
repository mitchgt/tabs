D         Bm
Ooooooooooooooooooh
Am                          B/A
D-d-d-did you see the frightened ones ?
Am                         B/A
D-d-d-did you hear the falling bombs ?
Am                    B/A
D-d-d-did you ever wonder
       Am                 A7
Why we had to run for shelter
             D              A
When the promise of a brave new world
         D         Bm
Unfouled beneath a clear blue sky ?


D         Bm
Ooooooooooooooooooh
Am                         B/A
D-d-d-did you see the frightened ones ?
Am                        B/A
D-d-d-did you hear the falling bombs ?
Am                         B
The flames are all long gone
                     D
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye  Blue Sky
    A7/D G/D  D
