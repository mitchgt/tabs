Songs she sang in the shower

[D]

On a [D] lark
On a whim
I said "there's [Am] two kinds of men in this [G] world and you're neither of [D] them"

And his fist
Cut the smoke 
I had an [Am] eigth of a second to [G] wonder if he got the [D] joke

In the car
Headed home
She asked if [Am] I had considered the [G] prospect of living [D] alone

With a steak
Held to my eye
I had to [Am] summon the confidence [G] needed to hear her [D] goodbye
And another [Am] brief chapter without [G] any  answers blew [D] by

<chorus>
And the [D] songs that she sang in the [G] shower are stuck in my [D] head [G]
like "Bring out your [D] dead" [A]
"Breakfast in [D] bed"

And experience robs me of [G] hope that she'll make it back [D] home [G]
So I'm stuck on my [D] own
I'm [A] stuck on my [D] own

In a room
By myself
Looks like I'm [Am] here with the guy that I [G] judge worse than anyone [D] else

So I pace
And I pray
And I [Am] repeat the mantras that [G] might keep me clean for a [D] day

And the [D] songs that she sang in the [G] shower all ring in my [D] ear [G]
Like "Wish you were [D] here" [A] 
How I wish you were [D] here


And experience robs me of [G] hope that you'll ever [D] return [G]
So I breath and I [D] burn [A]
I breath and I [D] burn

<bridge>
And the [Bm] church bells are ringing for [A] those that are easy to [G] please
And the [Bm]frost on the ground probly [A] envies the frost on the [G] trees
</bridge>

And the [D] songs that she sang in the [G] shower are stuck in my [D] mind [G] 
Like "Yesterday's [D] Wine" [A]
Like yesterday's [D] wine

And experience tells me that [G] I'll never hear them [D] again [G]
Without thinking of [D] them [A] 
Without thinking of [D] them
