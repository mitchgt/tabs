Secretariat 

 I need a woman with a heart like Secretariat
 To outrun my lonesome ways
 I'm going to take this extra rib I've got
 I'm going to bury it down in the dust 
 She does not raise

 I need a woman with eyes like Rodin
 To see the body caught within the stone
 I'm going to take this bronze star heart 
 I've got I'm going to melt it down
 Wait for love to cast the metal into bone

 Because I'm the blue eyed son of hurricane
 I'll twirl you so sweetly so around
 But be careful you know Atlanta 
 Never looked the same
 After she burned to the ground
 After she burned down

 I need a woman with a heel like Achilles
 So I know there's always one way I can win
 Love is patient, love is kind, but let's be honest 
 Love is a catalogue of deadly sins

 I need a woman with a chin like Joe Frazier
 To stand inside when I am swinging at the wind
 Let's you and me take the gloves off darlin
 I'll tell you exactly where I've been

 Because I'm the blue eyed son of hurricane
 I'll twirl you so sweetly so around
 But be careful you know Atlanta 
 Never looked the same
 After she burned to the ground
 After she burned down

 I need a woman with hands like John Henry
 Hard enough to break the rocks down into sand
 And when we died we'd lay down side by side
 With our hammers in our hands

 I need a woman with a heart like Secretariat
 To outrun my lonesome ways
 I'm going to take this extra rib I've got
 I'm going to bury it down in the dust
 She does not raise
