Lost Highway by Hank Williams

(I) I'm a rollin' stone all (IV) alone and (I) lost
For a life of sin I have paid the (V) cost
When I pass (IV) by all the people (I) say
Just another guy (V) on the lost (I) highway

Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like mine
Oh the day we met, I went astray
I started rolling down that lost highway

I was just a lad, nearly twenty two
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
Lord I take a cost, o the lost highway

Now boy's don't start to ramblin' round
On this road of sin are you sorrow bound
Take my advice or you'll curse the day
You started rollin' down that lost highway
