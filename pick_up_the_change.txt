Pick Up the Change
capo II

If its just your [G] heart
[Bm] talking
[G] I don't [C] mind
If [Am] you want to call me [G] darling
That's just [C] fine
That's just [Am] fine

But if it's your [G] mind
that's [Bm] wandering
[G] It'll fall in [C] line
[Am] When I kiss your [G] cheek dear
Every [C] time
Every [Am] time

[G] We [C] used to have a [Am] lot of things in common
[G] But you [C] know now we're [Am] just the same
[G] You always [C] had more [Am] than I really wanted
[G] Aw [C] honey help me [D]
[G] Aw [C] honey help me [D] pick up the [G] change

G Bm G C Am G C Am

If it's just your [G] heart
[Bm] talking
[G] Listen every [C] time
[Am] Dear you can talk my [G] ear off
any [C] time
any [Am] time

But if my [G] mind
starts [Bm] wandering
[G] Won't be gone [C] long
[C] Whenever I hear your heart [G] talking
It's a [C] song
It's a [Am] song

[G] We [C] used to have a [Am] lot of things in common
[G] But you [C] know now we're [Am] just the same
[G] You always [C] had more [Am] than I really wanted
[G] Aw [C] honey help me [D]
[G] Come on [C] honey help me [D] pick up
[G] Come on [C] honey help me [D] pick up the [G] change
