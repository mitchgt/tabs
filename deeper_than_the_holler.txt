[G] Well I've heard those city [C] singers singin' [G] 'bout how they can [C]love
[G] deeper than the [C] oceans higher [G] than the stars [C] above
well [G] I come from the [C] country and I [G] know I ain't seen it [C] all
but I [G] heard that oceans' [C] salty and the [G] stars they [C] sometimes [G] fall
but [Am] that would not do justice to the [Bm] way I feel for you
so I [C] have to sing this [Am] song about [C] all the things I [D] knew

Chorus:
My love is [G] deeper that the [C] holler, [G] stronger than the [C] rivers
[G] higher than the [Em] pine trees growin' [Am] tall upon the [D] hill
my love is [G] purer than the [C] snowflakes that [G] fall in [F#] late [Em]December
and [Am] honest as a robin on a [C] springtime window sill
and [Am] longer than the [D] song of the Whippoor-[G]-will

[G] From the backroads to the [C] broadway shows with a [G] million miles bet-[C]-ween
there's a [G] least a million [C] love songs that [G] people [C] love to [G] sing
and [Am] everyone is different and [Bm] everyone's the same
so [C] this is just another [Am] way of [C] sayin' the same [D] thing

Repeat Chorus 2X
