# I've got a little black book with  my poems in

# Got these swollen hand blues.

#     F                                        C
# Got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from

# On the telephone to you

# They'll be nobody home

#                C
# I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
#
#           E                        E7+
# And the inevitable pinhole burns
#
# F                                           C
# All down in the front of my favourite satin shirt
#
# F        C
# I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
#
#            E
# I've got a silver spoon on a chain
#
#            F                                  C
# I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
#
# C
# I've got wild staring eyes
#
# C7                                 F
# I've got a strong urge to fly
#
#     Fm                  C       E    Am    D7   G     E7
# But I've got nowhere to fly to
#
# Am         C                           D7
# Ooooh Babe when I pick up the phone
#
# Fm6                  C       F   C
# There's still nobody home
#
# F          C
# I've got a pair of Gohills boots
#
#             E       E7
# And I've got fading roots

Additional lyrics:

    I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
    And the inevitable pinhole burns
    All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
    I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
    I've got a silver spoon on a chain
    Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
    I've got wide staring eyes
    & I've got a strong urge to fly
    But I've got nowhere to fly to (fly to fly to fly to fly to)
    Ooooh babe, why not pick up the phone?
    There's still nobody home.

           C
I've got a pair of Gohill's boots
            E       E7
But I got fading roots.
