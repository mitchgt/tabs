Been All Around This World

[I] I'm a workin on the new railroad
with mud up to my knees
[V] Workin on that [I] new railroad
with [IV] mud up to my [I] knees
[IV] Workin for old John Henry
He's [I] mighty hard to please
I've [V] been all around this [I] world

Now when you go out fishin boys
take your hook and line
When you go out fishin boys
you take your hook and line
And when you go out courtin
you don't leave your bait behind
I've been all around this world

Well I went to town last Friday night
and Molly passed me by
I went to town last Friday night 
and Molly passed me by
I could tell her mind was changin
by the rovin of her eye
I've been all around this world

Now where'd you get them high heeled shoes
and the dress you wear so fine
Where'd you get them shiny shoes
and the dress you wear so fine
I found these shoes in a boxcar
and the dress wasn't far behind
I've been all around this world

Do you remember Molly 
when you took me by the hand
Do you remember Molly
you took me by the hand
you said if you'd ever marry
then I would be the man
I'v been all around this world

Now the new railroad is finished boys
the cars are on the track
The new railroad is finished boys
the cars are on the track
And Molly's ridin on down the line
and I know she won't come back
I've been all around this world

If you see a rich girl
send her on down the line
If you see that rich girl
send her on down the line
But if you see a poor girl
you can bet she's a friend of mine
I've been all around this world
