drunk in a band 
(Currie) 
Intro  E   A     B

E            A                 B
Adam is the guy with a record shop 
E              A                       B  
and John sells fruit but wants to be a cop 
E              A                 B  
and Paul deals speed in a celtic top 
E              A            B
but I'm just a drunk in a band 

Joe does telly sales and martial arts 
and Jim pushes patients 'round the public parks 
and Nancy makes sculptures out of Hoover parts 
but I'm just a drunk in a band 

Danny puts the cones on the motorway 
and Donna dances tables in her lingere 
and Jerry, Dave, and Billy, man, they're putting on a play 
but I'm just a drunk in a band

but I'm just a drunk in a band 

I could be a soldier, I could drive a van 
Get rivers of paint into little red cans 
Walk rich folks dogs bring 747s in to land 
I'm just a drunk in a band
