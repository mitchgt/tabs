(note to self: these chords aren't right)

Slow and sad in 3/4 time

INTRO:  G D C G   G D C G

I (C)remember the windows rolled down and the wind in your (G)hair  D C G
Driving (C)round in your daddy's old Chevy like we were going (G)somewhere
(e)We thought that summer would (D)last us forever
Going (a)steady was just something you do
I didn't (C)know much about (D)love
I learned that from (G)you  D C G

Now (C)those were some good times but lately they don't seem to (G)last  D C G
And I (C)guess I'm not nearly as strong as the drink in your (G)glass
And the (e)nights just get later, I could (D)stay up and wait or just
(a)Go on to bed like I do
I never (C)knew nothin' about (D)lonely
I learned that from (G)you

CHORUS:
And (C)I learned how to kiss on a ferris wheel and
(G)I made wishes at wishing wells
And (e)I fell (a)into that fairytale (D)too
Now (C)I know that love ain't so easy but
(G)We tried, didn't we baby?
It's (e)alright, (a)some dreams aren't made to come (D)true
I learned that from (G)you  D C G

One (C)night while the whole world was turning I left you a (G)note  D C G
I (C)told you that I'd always miss you, then I let you (G)go
Now I'm (e)living outside of some (D)town I ain't heard of
(a)I think about the boy that I knew
I didn't (C)know you could fall out of (D)love
I learned that from (G)you  D C G

CHORUS

I re(C)member the windows rolled down and the wind  G
