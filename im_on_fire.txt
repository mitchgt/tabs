                              A
Sometimes it's like someone took a knife baby
                                    E
edgy and dull and cut a six-inch valley
                    C#m
through the middle of my soul

     E
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet
and a freight train running through the
middle of my head
         A                          C#m
Only you can cool my desire
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire
A  B              E
Oh.... I'm on fire

E  C#m (x4)
