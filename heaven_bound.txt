HEAVEN BOUND (Damon Bramblett)
------------------------------
[Each chord is one measure, except pairs of chords joined with hyphens
 (e.g., C - G/B) are one measure total.]
[The chords in the intro are "implied"; the bass is playing C-B-A-B and two
 guitars are playing C-E-C, B-D-B, A-E-A, B-D-B an octave apart.]

[intro]

    C                      C                      Dm   Dm
Electricity roared but you looked so bored on the line
         Em                          Em                  Dm       Dm
Nobody knows how it felt to see that cannonball melt in your mind
C                          C                     Dm          Dm
Calling all cars, one less dog behind bars, one less man in pain
   Em                        Em                    Dm                  Dm
It hurts to see you go, but darling don't you know, we're so glad you came

minds; Only a fool would want to stick around
                    C - G/B   Am - G/B   C - G/B   Am - G/B
When you're heaven bound

Disconnect the phone, heart from bone, voice from mind
So sad and blue, how'd you do? 'Course, you did just fine
Grab a tail on this big gray whale and do your best to stay brave
In that final hour he's just a beautiful flower that couldn't be saved

You'll stay gone a long, long time
Day by day you'll fly across our minds
Only a fool would want to stick around
When you're heaven bound

[Guitar solo: 16 bars, same chords as one verse]

You'll stay gone a long, long time
Day by day you'll fly across our minds
Only a fool would want to stick around
When you're heaven bound

[Fade out over intro chords]
