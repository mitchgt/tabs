How To Fight Loneliness

Bm A6 G F#

[Bm] How to fight [A6] loneliness
[G] Smile all the [F#] time
[Bm] Shine your teeth til [A6] meaningless
[G] Sharpen them with [F#] lies

[Em] And whatever is going [A] down
[Em] Will follow you [A] around
That's [Bbo = x1202 or x1242] how you fight [Bm] loneliness
[D] You laugh at every [G] joke [F#]

[Bm] Drag your blanket [A6] blindly
[G] Fill your heart with [F#] smoke
[Em] And the first thing that you [A] want
[Em] Will be the last thing that you [A] need
That's [Bbo] how you fight it [Bm]
