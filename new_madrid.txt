G C G
All my daydreams are disasters
G C G
She's the one I think I love
G Em C
Rivers burn and then run backwards
G C G
For her That's enough
G C G
They all come from New York city
G C G
And they woke me up at dawn
G Em C
She walked with me to the fountain
G C G
She held on to my arm

Chorus:
G C Am
C'mon do what she did Roll me on to New Madrid
C D
Shake my baby and please bring her back
G C Am
'Cause death won't even be still It carries over the landfill
C D G
Buries us all in its broken back

There's a man of conviction and although he's getting old
Mr Browning has a prediction We've all been told
So come on back to New York City Roll your trucks in at dawn
Walk with me to the fountain and hold on to my arm

Chorus
