life is full 
(Currie) 
Intro
G D/F# C/E x 2

G      D/F#         C/E
People say you are a stand up guy 
G           D/F#            C/E
You'd never hurt no one and yet never try 
        G             D/F#
And you laugh and you cry 
        C/E                       Em             Bm             Am D
And you do all the things that anybody does to show they are alive


G      D/F#         C/E
Friends say you are a careful man 
G          D/F#          C/E
You always favour reason where you can
And you laugh and you cry 
And you do all the things that anybody does to show they are alive


        Bm       C       Bm       C
But wherever you go, whatever you do 
    Bm             C                           D
You know that they won't find a fool quite like you


             G        D/F# C/E
Yeah life is full (of easy choices) 
           D G        D/F#   C/E
Yeah life is full (of simple rules) 
                    Em        Bm      C
But when love comes you don't have no room 
             D    C/E  C
When life is full


G           D/F#            C/E
People say you are a patient guy 
G           D/F#            C/E
You'd never rush something if it ain't right 
And you laugh and you cry 
And you do all the things that anybody does to show they are alive


                                 G         C
And you make those mistakes that everybody does 
        D                      Em
And you deal with them as you go 
     Bm                        Em             C
From tripping on a shoelace to falling in love
                          D
You keep things under control


But wherever you go, whatever you do 
You know that they won't find a fool quite like you


Yeah life is full (of easy choices) 
Yeah life is full (of simple rules) 
But when love comes you don't have no room 
When life is full, full

G D C
