[D] Nibbling on sponge cake
Watching the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with [A] oil
Strumming my six string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp they're beginning to [D] boil [D7]

[G] Wasted [A] away again in [D] margaritaville [D7]
[G] Searching for my [A] lost shaker of [D] salt [D7]
[G] Some people [A] claim that there's a [D] woman [A] to [G] blame
But I [A] know
It's nobody's [D] fault

Don't know the reason
I stayed here all season
Nothing to show but this brand new tattoo
But it's a real beauty
A Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue

Wasted away again in margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
Now I think
Hell it could be my fault

I blew out my flip flop
Stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
But there's booze in the blender
And soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on

Wasting away again in margaritaville
Searching for my lost shaker of salt
Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know
It's my own damn fault

Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
But I know
It's my own damn fault
