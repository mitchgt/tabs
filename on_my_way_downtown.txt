How many times have I washed my face
Combed my hair, left this place
Felt the shiver in my chest when I hit the door
The promise of something here worth living for

Had a fight with the women
Who had my kids
Can't get along with anyone
What if I did
Going back to the corner
where we used to meet

I'm going out tonight
