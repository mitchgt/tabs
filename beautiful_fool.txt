[G] [C9] [G] [D] [Em9] [C9] [G] [D]
[G]August the 24th, [C9] 1991

[Em9] You're calling for me from the bedroom window
[D]I'm working on the lawn
Under a [Em9] northeastern sky
[C9]Hollow and gray
[G]You said, "everything's different now."
I said, "oh really, [D]I don't think anything's changed" [C9] [Em9] [G] [D]

[G]Telephone rings
[C9] It's the middle of the night
[Em9]"you're awfully quiet babe, [D] are you still alive?"
and every [Em9] star
[C]Looks down and grieves
[G]You turn and you open up wide
[D]And then you retreat [C9] [Em] [G] [D]

[Em9]Pale blue sky
[C9]Colder than hell
[G]If you're looking for me to make you feel
[D] Well I'm looking for that myself
And a [Em9]strong foundation
[C]That no heartache could shift
[G]And the grace of God, and for all this frustration [D]to finally lift
[C]My beautiful fool
[Em9]My beautiful fool
[G]Didn't you know
[D]I'm a fool [C]too?  [Em9] [G] [D] [C] [Em9] [G] [D] [C9]
