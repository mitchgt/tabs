[Intro]

It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

If I was a sculptur, but then again no
or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind  I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

[Intro]

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green, ha, or they're blue
Anyway, thie thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
