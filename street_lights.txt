[C] Rock and roll, [CM7] you are envy I am
[C] So uncool, [CM7] still I want to do
The [FM7] best I can, let's meet on the corner and
act like were old [C] friends [CM7]

We can talk about the [FM7] streetlights
The [G] people surrounding [FM7] you in a [G] haze
Wont you [G#o7] tell me how it [Am] feels
To be a [Am9] famous man at the [Am] wheel
You don't have a [Fm] master plan
But you will start [C] today
[Fm] You will start [C] today

Called you up, cause I felt so guilty
Ended up it was not such a pretty
scene, let's dump the ashtray
wipe the table clean

We can talk about the streetlights
The people surrounding you in a haze
Wont you tell me how it feels
To be a nervous man at the wheel
You don't have a master plan
But you will start today
You will start today
You will start

When [E] all of your fear is [Am] gone
And you're thinking that you're [F] strong enough
To make the jump up to the big, big
[C] sky [CM7] [C] [CM7] [FM7] [C] [CM7]

We can talk about the streetlights
The people, surrounding you
Its a strong pull
We can talk about the streetlights
The people going down
And you will start today
You will start today
You will start today
You will start today
