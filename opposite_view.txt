opposite view 
(Currie) 
Intro - the riff is really mucking about with A to B

                           A   B
We could be away from here 
                          A   B 
by ten o'clock tonight 
                                   A   B
Pennies won't get us to heaven, I know 
                               A   B
but a borrowed car just might 
                          A   B
Look through my wallet 
                               A   B
There's enough for a hotel room 
                         A   B
But no, no, no, you say 

"I wanna stay in and get wet with you." 

 A                              B
Why do you take the opposite view? 

 A                              B
Why do you take the opposite view? 

(same as verse 1)
We could be different people tonight 
Who do you want to choose? 
I'll book a table in a suit and tie 
and you can wear your sister's shoes 
Look through my wallet 
Which cities shall we travel through? 
But no, no, no you say "You just got paid, 
Money's not for wasting it's for holding onto." 

Why do you take the opposite view? 

         E                B
Is it something in your nature 
      E                B
that makes it hard to say, "Baby, I do." 
F#                   B 
  You don't have to agree 
        E                
when someone says they love you 
         A
But you don't have to take 
              B
the opposite view 

(same as verse 1)
We can walk on the roofs tonight 
and watch the midnight traffic flow 
Unscrew the lightbulbs babe, 
and we'll throw them from the 14th floor 
I say we're yellow 
if we don't do something new 
But you just laugh and start filling up my glass 
as if it's not true. 

Why do you take the opposite view? 

Every precious second there's a chance to change 
The present tense is perfect baby, 
Let's rearrange it.
