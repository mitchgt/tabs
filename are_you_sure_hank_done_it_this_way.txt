Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way? (1975)
Album: Dreaming My Dreams

[A] [D]

It’s the same old tune
Fiddle and guitar
Where do we take it from here?

Rhinestone suits and new shiny cars
It’s been the same way for years

We need a change

Somebody told me when I came to Nashville
Son you've finally got it made 

Ole Hank made it here 
And we're all sure that you will
But I don't think Hank done it this way
Naw, I don't think Hank done this way

Ten years on the road making one night stands
Speeding my young life away

Tell me one more time just so I'll understand
Are you sure Hank done it this way?
Did ol' Hank really do it this way?

Lord I've see the world with a five piece band
Looking at the backside of me

Singing my songs one of his now and then
But I don't think Hank did em  this way
No I don't think Hank did em this way
