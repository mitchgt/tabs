another one off of the Rainy Day Music album:

Capo 2
B7: x21202

Verse progression: [E, C#m, F#m, E, D, B7] x2
Chorus: [A, E, F#m, A, E] x2

E C#m
As I lay up on my bed I began dreaming
F#m E D B7
How it’s gonna be the day that I am free
E C#m
Once I settled like the dust up on the table 
F#m E D B7
But then you came along, you helped me right this song

A E
I don’t know what day it is, I can’t recall the season 
F#m A E
I don’t remember how we got this far 
A E
All I know’s I’m loving you for all the right reasons
F#m A E B7 (? -- not sure if it’s a B7 or D)
My sky you’ll always will be my morning star

Like a tired bird flying high across the ocean
I was outside looking in, you made me live again
From the mountains to the prairies little babies
Figures filled their heads, visions bathed in red

I don’t know what day it is, I can’t recall the season 
I don’t remember how we got this far 
All I know’s I’m loving you for all the right reasons
My sky you’ll always will be my morning star

Interlude

B|--4-5-7-4-5-7-4-5-7-4-5-7-4-5-7-4-|

B|----4-5---4-5---4-5---4-5---4-5--|
G|--6-----6-----6-----6-----6-----6--|

Then just the “B” line twice more

E C#m (etc.)
From the train in Manchester, England
Lightening fills the sky as I watched you wave goodbye
From the mountains to the prairies little babies
Figures filled their heads, visions bathed in red

I don’t know what day it is, I can’t recall the season 
I don’t remember how we got this far
All I know’s I’m loving you for all the wrong reasons
My sky you’ll always will be my morning star

 Thanks for posting......I have been fooling around with the song and I know my ears are not the best but I've played the song this way

F#m D B
How it’s gonna be the day that I am free

I didn't hear an "E" in there after F#m. Also had a hard time telling the difference between B and B7. Maybe I am wrong but the even though I have been playing F#m, it seems to me that this does not sound exactly right. Anyone else out there that can help out?

 Great job! Sounds good.

A couple of minor fixes:

about:
F#m E D B
How it’s gonna be the day that I am free

That E is just a passing strum of open strings; it sounds fine without but it's there.

about:
F#m A E B7 (? -- not sure if it’s a B7 or D)
In my sky you’ll always will be my morning star

We use F#m A E B, then add a 7 up on the high E string

lyrics: some minor typos "write this song" and of course, he loves her for all the right reasons, even through the last chorus.

When we saw the Jayhawks in Boston, it looked like the instrumental bridge was picked like this:

B-8-------
G------7--
E----0----

B-6-----
G---4---
E------0-

 I'm pretty sure this song is played with open key of G chord forms with the guitar tuned down 1/2 step with no capo. See what you think:
These are the chords you would use if your guitar was tuned down.
G Em Am F D
