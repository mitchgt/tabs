G5                           C                                    D11
When the world is full of strangers and your nights are dark and dangerous
                             C                    D5
There's a place where you can hang and just let it go

When your eyes see only sorrow and your life seems some how borrowed
                        C                D5
And those long promised tomorrows never show


D11          X                    C
Well come on down we're waiting for you
D11          X               D5
We've got a special evening planned
C            X                  D5
We're gonna push the boat out or you
          C               G5
Might get drowned on dry land


Intro Chords Repeat

When the road looks long lonely when the sky is overloaded
When you feel like you're the only one in pain
When your smile gets weak and weary when your weirded out and weary
And you long to be somewhere they know your name

Well come on down we're waiting for you we've got a special evening planned
We're gonna push the boat out or you might get drowned on dry land

Yeah you can try to take it, try to hide it or try to fake it
Yeah you can try to make a stand
But someday they will find you shaking and holding up your hands saying
Someone take me back to some way of living that I understand ......I understand

When your will to live is choking when your spirit has been broken
When the whole damn thing seems token and mundane
When the blackness all around you crowds you out and hounds you
Picks you up and crowns you kings of the lane

Well come on down we're waiting for you we've got a special evening planned
We're gonna push the boat out or you You might get drowned on dry land
