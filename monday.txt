[G] Choo-choo Charlie had a plenty good band
But he couldn't understand why no one would go
A world record players on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixing his van with the left arm tan

He said, [C] "Monday, I'm [G] all high
[C] Get me out of of FLA [F] 
In school yeah, I [C] fooled ya
[F] Now I know I made a mistake [G]"

Blister on a turnpike, let me by
I only wanna wonder why when I don't die
Ew I shot ya, yeah I know
I only wanna go where my wheels roll

Monday [G] I'm all high
[C] Get me out of FLA [F] 
I fooled ya, in [C] school yeah
[F] Now I know I made a mistake [G]
I made a big mistake

Everybody's wondering "where'd he go"
He must be down in Pensacola hiding from the snow
The world record players on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixing his van, he's waiting for a postcard

And he said, [C] "Monday, I'm [G] all high
[C] Get me out of of TLA [F]
Well I [F] cut class, in [C] school yeah
[F] Now I know I made a mistake [G]
I made a big mistake

Alright
