[Em] say you're tired 
[G]say you're busy
[Em] you can lie to me 
[ ] should come easy
for [ ] you have been [ ] doing it for a [ ] while

look away when I'm talking
please don't say what you're thinking
you have been thinking for a while
you have been thinking for a while

take you're hands out of your pockets and hold me
turn your eyes round in their sockets til you can see
The way that I look at you

I am just a ray of sun 
you are daylight
I'm an early morning 
you were a good night
and a prayer before I go to sleep

when you could be straight ahead 
you go sideways
when you're lyin in your bed it's a long way
from the place that you want it to be

grab a hold of anything that's worth keeping
from your house of flames that you should be leaving
or stay and let it burn you down
let burn you down
