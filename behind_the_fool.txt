behind the fool 
(Currie) 
Intro 
F  C C/B Am Am/G F  G

C  C/B       Am        Am/G          F
      Don't tell her that you want her 
C  C/B      Am    Am/G     F
    Don't ask her to be yours 
C  C/B     Am     Am/G      F    G
    Don't tell her she is everything 

    Dm                Dm/C           Dm/B
Or she might see the fool behind the frown 
              F      Fm         C
And then the heart behind the fool 

(Same as verse 1)
Don't tell her that you need her 
Don't tell her that you care 
Don't ask her to hold you 

Or she might see the fool behind the frown 
And then the heart behind the fool 

            Am               Am/G 
Behind the cool, there's a dreading that 
    Am/F#            F
Someday she'll betray you 
   E               D 
Someday she will dispose of 
         Dm              G
All her photographs of you 

(same as verse 1)
So don't tell her when you're lonely 
Don't tell her when you're blue 
Don't tell her she means everything to you 

So don't tell her that you need her 
Don't tell her that you care 
Don't ask her to hold you 

(same as chorus)
Or she might see the fool behind the frown 
And then the heart behind the fool
