                 What I Am - Edie Brickell
                ------------------------------

Tabbed by Christopher Weetly

Intro/Main Riff :
------------------

This is all based on the sus2 shape :

 EADGBE
 x24422

  Bsus2

Just move it up two D, then down to A, then back to B.

E-----------------------------5-------------------------------2----
B---------2----2--------5------------------------0------------2----
G---------4----4--------------------------2----2---------4---------
D---------4----4------7-------------------2--2---------4-----------
A--2--2-2----2------5------5-------0-0-0-------------2------2------
E------------------------------------------------------------------

Verse :
--------
Keep repeating the main riff over these words :


I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know if you know what I mean

(Repeat once)

Philosophy is the talk on a cereal box
Religion is the smile on a dog
I'm not aware of too many things
I know what I know if you know what I mean
De-doo yeah

Chorus:
--------
Em              D
Chuck me in the shallow water 
Em               D
Before I get too deep

(Repeat once - I think ..)

Then back to the main riff.

The whole song is just these two parts - the sus2 riff
alternating with Em and D for the chorus.

There's a little lead line on guitar over the chorus :
  Em                     D
E---12---15---12-----12---------14---12------
B----------------15------15--15----------15--
G--------------------------------------------
D--------------------------------------------
A--------------------------------------------
E--------------------------------------------

    Chuck  me in  the    shallow water

I haven't really got the solo yet, but I know it's based on the E Minor Dorian, and u can guide yourself from the lead chorus part too, so it shouldn't be that hard really, I just normally change it everytime I play and give it some of my own flavore.
