First Country Song
B-Side to Baby Ain't Got Back

(note: explore as murder ballad)

waltz

You [D] said I love this old guitar, [A] more than I love you
I [G] told you a thousand times, it ain't [D] true
You said if I don't put this old [A] guitar down
You're [G] gonna take my dog and head out of [D] town

[Chorus]
If you leave, I'm gonna [A] write my country song
About [G] how you took my dog, and how you did me [D] wrong
I guess it's good you didn't [A] leave me for a man
[G] But you took my dog, and that I cannot [D] stand

My [D] country song'll have that [A] high lonesome sound
[G] Just like my dog, when the [D] moon rises from the ground
I do not think honey that [A] I will miss you
[G] You took my dog, and [D] now I am blue

When you leave, I'm gonna [A] write my country song
[G] About how you took my dog, and [D] how you did me wrong
I guess it's good you didn't [A] leave me for a man
[G] But you took my dog, and that I can not [D] stand

I guess I'll have to put [A] this old guitar down
[G] fire up my truck [D] head in to town
I'll catch you and my dog when you stop gas
I'm gonna take my dog and you can kiss my ass

When you leave, I'm gonna write my first country song
About how you took my dog, and how you did me wrong
I guess it's good you didn't leave me for another man
But you took my dog, and that I can not stand

I play my old guitar on the front porch every night
While fire files and dogs dance in pale the moonlight
Country Song's a hit, playin on the radio
I heard you a listenin as you drove up the road

When you leave, I'm gonna write my Country Song
About how you took my dog, and how you did me wrong
I guess it's good you didn't leave me for man
But you took my dog, and that I can not stand

Now you're back and I'm a big country star
My dog's a celebrity; he's a real nice big

You said I love this old guitar, more than I love you
And I told you a thousand times, it ain't true
You said if I don't put this old guitar down
You're gonna take my dog and head out of town

When you leave, I'm gonna write my first country song
About how you took my dog, and how you did me wrong
I guess it's good you didn't leave me for another man
But you took my dog, and that I can not stand

My first country song will have that high lonesome sound
Kind of like my dog, when the moon rises from the ground
I do not think honey that I will miss you
But you took my dog, and now I am so blue

When you leave, I'm gonna write my first country song
About how you took my dog, and how you did me wrong
I guess it's good you didn't leave me for another man
But you took my dog, and that I can not stand

I guess I'll have to put this old guitar down
Fire up the truck and head in to town
I'll catch you and my dog when stop to get gas
I'm gonna take my dog and you can kiss my ass

When you leave, I'm gonna write my first country song
About how you took my dog, and how you did me wrong
I guess it's good you didn't leave me for another man
But you took my dog, and that I can not stand

Now I play my guitar on the front porch every night
While firefiles and dogs dance in the moonlight
My country song's a hit, playin on the radio
I heard you listenin to it as you drove back up the road

When you leave, I'm gonna write my first country song
About how you took my dog, and how you did me wrong
I guess it's good you didn't leave me for another man
But you took my dog, and that I can not stand


And now your back and I'm a big star
My dog's a celebrity and he's gonna go far
You and I are in love and love is strong
My country song and dog together prove we belong

Now yo'll never leave and take my dog
My county song, my dog and you
we are happy, we'll never be blue

now I'm gonna write my second country song 
About you and I and how we can't be wrong
Our dog and this old guitar
All together we know we never be afar
