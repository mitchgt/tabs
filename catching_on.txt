Can't find the reason, can't find the way,
               G/D              D               A    Asus4
Guess it's not you and me, only dogs have their day.
                G/D        
Another case of words that melt,
                       D          A     Asus4
It's not a question of right nightmares.

         C
In broad daylight,
       G             D
Season crash, season burn,
   A            C
Survive another turn.
        G                  D      A
Now I'm reaching out, it's true.
                  G/D              D     
And you don't see me, I'm catching on to you.
          G/D                  D     A 
You don't see me, I'm catching on to you.

Took a break to get that far,
Like the sound from a hundred dollar guitar
Bought from an old catalogue
Yesterday's dust and heartache.
'Cause the pieces fall like candy when you're young, medicine

When you're old,
There's no reason or rhyme,
Sidestepping around
On an elevator climb.
And you don't see me, I'm catching on to you.

Another jail, another burnout inside,
Skeleton low, left to die.
Take whatever lies ahead,
Good with the bad, and leave the rest.

And you don't see me, I'm catching on to you.
You don't see me, I'm catching on to you.
Catching on, catching on.
