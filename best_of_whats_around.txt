hey my friend, it seems your eyes are troubled.
care to share your time with me
would you say you're feeling low and so a good idea would be
to get it off your mind


Chorus 1
  you & me  have a..most..better.all..so       through

e--5-----------2-----------------------0---4---5-------------


see you and me have a better time than most can dream
have it better than the best
so can pull on through whatever tears at us whatever holds us down
and if nothing can be done we'll make the best of what's around

Chorus 2

  turns out not where but who youre with that really matters
   A    C#m      Bm                  G                (like intro)

  and hurts not much when you're around

Verse 2 (like verse 1)

and if you hold on tight to what you think is your thing
you may find you're missing all ther rest
well she run up into the light surprised
her arms are open her mind's eye

Chorus 3

seeing things from a better side than most can dream
on a clearer road i feel oh you could say she's safe
whatever tears at her whatever holds her down
if if nothing can be done she'll make the best of what's around

Chorus 4

turns out not where but what you think that really matters
