[C] [G/B] [F] [Am] [G] [F]

[C]Wandering out[G]side our old [F]house
[Am]Tragically ad[G]dressed trying to coax your [F]ghost out
[C]These are some [G]things I'm ready to con[F]front
[Am]Some that I [G]didn't do, and some that I had [F]done

[C]Angry and [G]sad over a cup of black [F]tea
[Am]Your watery [G]eyes and perfume were [F]choking me
[C]But I don't [G]need to tell you how it [F]went
[Am]Except that all things [G]beautiful are murdered in[ F]silence

(Chorus)
[C]Sadly [G]love, I never really let you [F]in
[Am]I need your little [G]hands to hold my ex[F]pression
[C]Cause I've been [G]cursed until the kingdom [F]comes
[Am]To always [G]have and miss some[F]one
[Am]To always [G]have and miss some[F]one

[C] [G/B] [F] [Am] [G] [F]

[C]I was one [G]bedroom with dog and a [F]thorn
[Am]I remember thinking of my [G]dad
As I was walking out the [F]door
[C]And looking[G] back, seeing the girl you never [F]should be
[Am]Heartbroke and [G]poor, lovesick and [F]lonely

(Repeat chorus)
