Watch Me Fall

intro: G  C G Em C (play 2 times)

G (lotsa picking)
Well some folks find
C
That their role in life
D     Dsus
Is to fail
   Em         C    G
At everything they try

G
While other folks see
C
But not like me
D           Dsus
There's one thing
     Em      C    G
That they're damn good at
G  C G Em  C

D                 Dsus D    Em C
Well gather 'round you all
D           Dsus D  Em C
Come around and see
D         Dsus  D
Those who stand tall
Am            C
Why don't you please
Em    D  G
Watch me fall

G  C G Em  C
G  C G Em  C

The hole it is wide
And it's there to divide
It's no one's fault
It was put there by design
G  C G Em  C
G  C G Em  C

And there's a bridge yet to build
As many men have willed
It's in the way
Of all those who wish to pass
G  C G Em  C
G  C G Em  C

So gather 'round you all
Come around and see
Those who stand tall
Why don't you please
Watch me fall
G  C G Em  C
G  C G Em  C
