Rock Bottom

A E A

You can [A] tell that I'm a [D] big man in this [A] town
And I'm the king of every street that I [E] walk down
It ain't [A] much to brag about but it's all [D] mine
From [A] Main Street to the [E] city limits [A] sign

Welcome to [A] Rock Bottom [D] population [A] one
Just over by the mountain where a fool fell [E] from
And if you're looking for [D] heartaches stop and get you [A] some [D]
Down in [A] Rock Bottom [E] population [A] one

When I [A] said goodbye to [D] her I felt so [A] strong
I thought I knew my way but somewhere I went [E] wrong
Now I'd [A] trade this lonesome world to hold her [D] near
But I [A] don't think she could [E] reach me way down [A] here

Welcome to [A] Rock Bottom [D] population [A] one
Just over by the mountain where a fool fell [E] from
And if you're looking for [D] heartaches, stop and get you [A] some [D]
Down in [A] Rock Bottom [E] population [A] one

You could make it your [D] home town
No matter where you're [A] from [D]
Down in [A] Rock Bottom [E] population [A] one
