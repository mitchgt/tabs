Northbound 35 

Standard tuning, capo II, key of D


Northbound 35
 Through the iron hills
 Under infidel skies
 It's two hundred miles to drive
 You won't be home 

I saw an elsebound train
 On the overpass 
 In the driving rain
 Every ticket costs the same
 For where you can't go

Chorus:
 Mustang horses, champagne glasses
 Anything frail anything wild
 It’s the price of living motion
 What's beautiful is broken
 And grace is just the measure of a fall

So I rolled into your town
 I passed the smokestacks 
 And the ore docks down off of Main
 And the sky spun around
 With her diamonds on fire

We fought all night and then we danced
 In your kitchen
 You were as much in my hands
 As water or darkness or nothing
 Can ever be held

Chorus

It's just flashes that we own
 Little snapshots 
 Made from breath and from bone
 Out on the darkling plain alone
 They light up the sky

It's 51 and driving south
 Ain't it funny 
 How things'll turn out
 I never even kissed you on the mouth
 When we said good-bye

Chorus
